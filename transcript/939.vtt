00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.889
Decent. I'm your host as always Ricardo Lob and

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.130
to the MG by Doctor Mi Michael Petralia. He

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.989
is director of the Australian Research Center for Human

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.270
Evolution at Griffith University in Australia. His research has

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.229
centered on a range of subjects concerning human evolution,

7
00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:23.309
including the evolution of cognition, the evolution of behavior,

8
00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:27.725
year and the relations between climate change and dispersal.

9
00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:30.745
And today we're going to talk about uh some

10
00:00:30.754 --> 00:00:34.345
aspects of human evolution, the origins of Homo Sapiens,

11
00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:38.514
human dispersal, the relationship between climate change and human

12
00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:41.944
dispersal or as I referred to earlier and other

13
00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:44.994
related topics. So, Doctor Petralia, welcome to the show.

14
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:46.505
It's a big pleasure to everyone.

15
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.380
Thank you Ricardo. Thanks for having me.

16
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.159
So, before we get into Homo sapiens, our species,

17
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.529
could you tell us a little bit about what

18
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.950
we know prior to the speciation of Homo sapiens?

19
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.480
Sure. Yeah. Um There are fossils all over Africa

20
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:14.529
anywhere between 803 100,000 years ago and they're generally

21
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.239
characterized as Homo Hedl burns. Um And this is

22
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.790
a closely related ancestor to Homo Sapiens. In fact,

23
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.639
perhaps the precedent of Homo sapiens. Um BUT they're

24
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.040
morphologically different from us and thus the species name,

25
00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:35.319
uh and they have very uh wide faces and

26
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.730
sloping foreheads and very thick and prominent brow ridges.

27
00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.339
So if in fact very different from our own

28
00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.239
skull shape, but they have pretty large brains. Uh

29
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.180
So their, their, their brains are about 1200 cubic

30
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.709
centimeters. And in Homo sapiens, we have brain size

31
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.089
of about 1400 cc. So they are a large

32
00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.989
brained um um ancestor. They are also fairly tall.

33
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.800
They have very, very robust bodies. Uh And uh

34
00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:08.250
but they are tall, uh they have very long

35
00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:10.630
legs and you know, some of them are about

36
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.190
up to 100 80 centimeters in height. Um It's

37
00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.669
like 6 ft tall. So, uh and, and they

38
00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:22.320
are a species that um um well, you know,

39
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.970
that potentially led to us, but also a species

40
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.440
that also exited Africa. And so some of the

41
00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:34.470
early exits of Homo Hydrogens may be 5 800,000

42
00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:38.869
years ago. Um In terms of their culture, they

43
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.470
had some very advanced uh technology. So they used

44
00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.130
um tool kits that are known as the Schulian.

45
00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.770
And these are very large hand axes and cleaver

46
00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:56.589
uh tool forms. Uh They're handheld uh stone tool

47
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.300
technologies and they will probably use butchery, you know,

48
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:04.770
against uh uh carcasses, for example. And we know

49
00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.639
that Homo Hydrogens had some advanced technologies not only

50
00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.899
in terms of stone tools but, you know, the

51
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.490
controlled use of fire. So, these fossils are found

52
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.240
all across Africa, uh, and, uh, you know, generally

53
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.649
well known species,

54
00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.630
uh, but are, are we completely sure that we

55
00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.630
speciated from Homo Heald Heidelberg or is that the

56
00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.570
best hypothesis out there for the time being? Because,

57
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.110
uh, I mean, I've already talked with other, uh,

58
00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:43.309
anthropologists, paleoanthropologists, biological anthropologists on the show. And at

59
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.500
least for now it seems to me if I'm

60
00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:50.649
reading the literature correctly that there are a few

61
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.460
aspects of omid evolution that are a bit uh

62
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.259
messy. Right.

63
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.000
Yes. And Homo Hydrogens is one of those very

64
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:04.889
problematic species because uh you know, they're, some people

65
00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.259
are very happy to call all these fossils. I've

66
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.500
described as Homo Hydrogens in Africa, but also in

67
00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:14.169
Asia. And so it's very geographically widespread and there

68
00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:19.529
is variation in morphology of uh those skeletal remains

69
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.230
and the, and the characteristics of the morphology. So

70
00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:26.290
you get into debates obviously in terms of naming

71
00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:31.095
species based on variations of morphology. But, you know,

72
00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:33.915
generally speaking, uh you know, Homo hydro against us

73
00:04:33.924 --> 00:04:37.695
is like a transitional spec species I believe. Um

74
00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:40.225
And, and for the reasons I described like, you

75
00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:44.184
know, the, these large brained creatures that seem to

76
00:04:44.195 --> 00:04:48.904
be immediately transitional to us in Africa.

77
00:04:49.454 --> 00:04:53.790
Mhm. So let's get into, I guess one of

78
00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:58.170
the most contentious questions in the evolution of Homo

79
00:04:58.179 --> 00:05:03.570
sapiens. So, did we appear in one single location

80
00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:07.869
in Africa or multiple locations? I mean, what does

81
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.459
the evidence tell us? And I know there's lots

82
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.839
of discussions surrounding that topic. But, uh, what are

83
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.760
your thoughts on it?

84
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.190
Well, listen, traditionally, um, you know, a lot of

85
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.070
debates centered on exactly where Homo Sapiens arose in

86
00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:26.910
Africa and there was always a back and forth

87
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.720
debates. Is it, it's South Africa, is it eastern

88
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.769
Africa? Where exactly is it? And, you know, a

89
00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.190
lot of time and energy has been spent on

90
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.470
that in terms of the search, but also the

91
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.790
debates that emerged from that in terms of the

92
00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:44.450
exact place of origin. But in recent years and

93
00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:46.929
this is part research that I'm involved in. Um

94
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.029
BUT headed by Ellie Sherry, um you know, she

95
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.149
wrote a very prominent article a few years back

96
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.239
talking about there is no single origin point per

97
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.910
se and that looking for a single origin point

98
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.709
of our speciation is kind of futile to do

99
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.299
that because um you know, you have to imagine

100
00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:12.910
a scenario where populations are distributed all across this

101
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.399
gigantic continent we call Africa. And sometimes they were,

102
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.709
you know, I I at certain times they were

103
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.730
in contact with each other, these populations. Uh AND

104
00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:27.690
sometimes there was isolation. So, you know, you get

105
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.529
this sort of back and forth contact or isolation

106
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.100
between populations. And it's very possible there was almost

107
00:06:35.109 --> 00:06:39.149
like a mosaic evolution that, you know, populations sometimes

108
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.450
contributed to other populations in terms of interbreeding and

109
00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:46.929
such. So, looking for the exact point at which

110
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.660
we call fossils, homo sapiens, it is very difficult

111
00:06:51.738 --> 00:06:55.247
to do and in fact, may be incorrect because

112
00:06:55.257 --> 00:06:57.238
there could, you know, be a lot of uh

113
00:06:57.338 --> 00:07:04.048
interbreeding and recombination between populations which eventually led to

114
00:07:04.268 --> 00:07:07.417
um the species we know as Homo sapiens.

115
00:07:07.747 --> 00:07:12.097
Mhm. Perhaps uh some of the confusion here has

116
00:07:12.108 --> 00:07:14.958
to do with the way we tend to think

117
00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:18.295
about the species as a concept, right? I mean,

118
00:07:18.305 --> 00:07:21.295
because you mentioned there that it could have been

119
00:07:21.305 --> 00:07:24.985
a sort of mosaic evolution and we have this

120
00:07:24.996 --> 00:07:30.786
idea that there's one species that evolves into another

121
00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:35.105
and uh it has to appear supposedly in one

122
00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:38.256
single location because this idea that we have of

123
00:07:38.265 --> 00:07:42.074
species, it wouldn't make much sense that the the

124
00:07:42.084 --> 00:07:46.014
same species would appear in different locations. I mean,

125
00:07:46.023 --> 00:07:49.134
how would that happen? Because how would it be

126
00:07:49.384 --> 00:07:52.253
the same species and how would it be able

127
00:07:52.264 --> 00:07:56.014
to uh I mean, elements or individuals from different

128
00:07:56.023 --> 00:07:59.653
populations? Iw, how would they be able to interbreed

129
00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:01.803
and all of that? Right. So I, I mean,

130
00:08:01.843 --> 00:08:04.334
ii I might be wrong but perhaps it has

131
00:08:04.343 --> 00:08:08.312
something to do with how we think about these

132
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.552
issues. Right.

133
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:13.122
Absolutely. No, I think you're spot on actually. Um

134
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:15.981
And I think that is the issue is that,

135
00:08:16.252 --> 00:08:18.402
you know, to what degree was there mixing and

136
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:22.252
mating versus, you know, this sort of linear view

137
00:08:22.261 --> 00:08:24.622
that we might have one species gives rise to

138
00:08:24.631 --> 00:08:28.011
another species, which gives rise to yet another. I

139
00:08:28.022 --> 00:08:31.092
mean, so I think, you know, evolution doesn't exactly

140
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:34.068
work in that way. Um And so what you

141
00:08:34.078 --> 00:08:36.847
were describing, I think is quite accurate. And also

142
00:08:37.138 --> 00:08:41.249
when you're looking at very rare fossils that have

143
00:08:41.258 --> 00:08:46.568
morphological variability, you also have the problem of discriminating

144
00:08:46.809 --> 00:08:50.679
precisely what you mean by a species. Number one.

145
00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:53.528
And some of the morphological variability may have nothing

146
00:08:53.539 --> 00:08:56.609
to do with biological change. But rather even, you

147
00:08:56.619 --> 00:09:00.249
know, adaptive variability that you see in a skeleton,

148
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.140
um having to do with, you know, how you're

149
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.630
uh adapting to the terrain, for example. So, so

150
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.640
it's extremely difficult from an, you know, an evolutionary

151
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.130
standpoint over these periods of time to precisely discriminate

152
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.619
a species. And maybe that is a feudal effort

153
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.460
as well. And, you know, DNA has come to

154
00:09:22.469 --> 00:09:26.315
bear on this subject and, you know, there's not

155
00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:31.715
an exact agreement between DNA and morphology, but in

156
00:09:31.724 --> 00:09:35.715
general, I think, you know, everyone's pretty comfortable with

157
00:09:35.724 --> 00:09:39.434
the idea that our species, you know, uh is

158
00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:43.554
around anywhere between 250 to 300,000 years ago in

159
00:09:43.565 --> 00:09:44.234
Africa.

160
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.219
And then there's also the issue that sometimes we

161
00:09:49.229 --> 00:09:53.549
find fossils that are even sometimes called sort of

162
00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:58.669
transitional fossils where we're not completely sure if it's

163
00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:03.229
still uh the previous I, I mean, it's II

164
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.150
I don't really like to use this sort of

165
00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:07.549
language, but I'm going to talk this way for

166
00:10:07.809 --> 00:10:11.940
the sake of simple, the previous species are already

167
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.460
almost sapiens because it has sort of, in terms

168
00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:19.159
of its morphology, it has sort of traits that

169
00:10:19.169 --> 00:10:22.570
are intermediate or something like that. And so, I

170
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.409
mean, again, the way we classify species, particularly in

171
00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:32.760
this case, ominous species is also, uh I'm, I'm

172
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.280
in a domain of debate. Yeah,

173
00:10:36.289 --> 00:10:39.260
absolutely. And I think the important thing is what

174
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.619
I was really just saying is that I think

175
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.650
it's really interesting to explore, you know, the variability

176
00:10:46.659 --> 00:10:50.109
uh of these populations, really, I think we're looking

177
00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:53.979
really at population variation and that's what's really interesting

178
00:10:54.219 --> 00:11:00.340
and how the populations are changing and adapting and,

179
00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:04.900
you know, potentially interbreeding. Um And so, and, and,

180
00:11:04.909 --> 00:11:06.440
and like I said, I think there's generally a

181
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.080
consensus as to when our species arose, generally speaking.

182
00:11:11.359 --> 00:11:14.119
So I, I think that, you know, getting into,

183
00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:17.599
you know, real debates and sort of splitting hairs

184
00:11:17.609 --> 00:11:21.770
on exactly when did Homo sapiens arise and exactly

185
00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:24.580
where did they arise is kind of not what

186
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.130
we're really after from an evolutionary standpoint anyway?

187
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.020
Ok. But, uh I mean, if there's at least

188
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:38.320
the possibility that we've uh arose in several different

189
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:44.580
locations and across different populations, is there any evidence

190
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:49.679
that there were also populations of Homo sapiens that

191
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.679
might have evolved outside of Africa or did we

192
00:11:54.690 --> 00:12:00.979
only appear initially even though across different populations within

193
00:12:01.239 --> 00:12:01.900
Africa?

194
00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:06.400
Yeah. Listen, I think that all the evidence right

195
00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:11.200
now comfortably suggests that we arose in Africa. Um

196
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.320
And I, and that's the combination of evidence from,

197
00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:18.390
you know, from the fossils from the DNA, from

198
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.260
the archaeological support that you may have in that.

199
00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:24.479
So I think Africa really is the homeland of

200
00:12:24.489 --> 00:12:28.109
Homo Sapiens. And I, you know, I would, you

201
00:12:28.119 --> 00:12:33.320
know, almost strictly maintain that, however, there are suggestions

202
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.869
that Sapiens might have been sort of, uh, in

203
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.609
areas geographically very proximate to Africa, like in places

204
00:12:41.619 --> 00:12:45.890
like Arabia where, you know, it's very close. Um,

205
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.710
AND it's possible some populations were there and they

206
00:12:49.719 --> 00:12:52.869
contributed to what, you know, the gene pool of

207
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.989
what was going on in Africa. So, you know,

208
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.080
I think that, you know, but, but if you're

209
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.460
gonna start arguing that Homo Sapiens could have ari

210
00:13:00.489 --> 00:13:04.150
arisen in far eastern Asia and things like that.

211
00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:06.469
I don't think that's the case at all, you

212
00:13:06.479 --> 00:13:06.700
know.

213
00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:08.760
No, no, not at all. I mean, uh, I

214
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.039
hear I was asking you just to be sure

215
00:13:12.049 --> 00:13:14.159
that it was at least as far as, you

216
00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:16.599
know, we know that it was just in Africa.

217
00:13:16.719 --> 00:13:20.650
And also because I heard a couple of times

218
00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:23.200
as you said, there are people talking about the

219
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.510
Arabian peninsula and now and then about perhaps southern

220
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.924
Europe. But, uh, it's, it's African, at least as

221
00:13:31.934 --> 00:13:34.534
far as we. Absolutely. And, and I think I'd

222
00:13:34.544 --> 00:13:38.025
say there's suggestions that maybe a place like Arabia

223
00:13:38.034 --> 00:13:42.085
could have um contributed, but these are almost suggestions

224
00:13:42.094 --> 00:13:47.794
that have possibilities. So it's not factually based or

225
00:13:47.804 --> 00:13:52.474
clear in the evidentiary record itself. Yeah.

226
00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:57.900
By the way, uh in anthropology, what do you

227
00:13:57.909 --> 00:14:02.320
mean? Uh OR what do anthropologists in general mean

228
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.859
when they mention modern humans? What is a modern

229
00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:08.650
human? Exactly? I

230
00:14:08.659 --> 00:14:14.250
mean, I, I actually personally steer away from terms

231
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.219
like anatomically modern humans or modern humans. I prefer

232
00:14:19.229 --> 00:14:21.809
in all of my writings and even discussions to

233
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.190
go with species names. So as not to confuse

234
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.750
people because you know, when you use terms like

235
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.150
this, it means something different for different practitioners or

236
00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:35.190
the public. Um And so I think that can

237
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.460
be quite confusing, even the term human can mean

238
00:14:38.469 --> 00:14:41.849
something different for different people and even different scholars.

239
00:14:41.859 --> 00:14:44.880
So my preference is always to try to use

240
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.739
the species name. So as to be super clear

241
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.359
on what we're talking about.

242
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:55.030
Mhm And what were the kinds of environments that

243
00:14:55.039 --> 00:15:01.489
Homo sapiens specifically evolved in within Africa? Was it

244
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:07.309
savanna rainforest or some other kinds of environments?

245
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.630
Melissa, we have fossils of Homo sapiens all across

246
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.830
Africa from 300,000 years ago on up. And if

247
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.250
that's the case, you know, it's a large geographic

248
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.729
place and you know, from north to south east

249
00:15:21.739 --> 00:15:24.880
to west. And if you just think about Africa

250
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.849
today, you have such a diverse array of environments

251
00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:32.960
today. And that was the same in the past

252
00:15:32.969 --> 00:15:36.349
and these environments were fluctuating through time over the

253
00:15:36.359 --> 00:15:40.400
last 300,000 years. And yet we have archaeology and

254
00:15:40.409 --> 00:15:44.400
fossils in all these geographic spaces. And so I

255
00:15:44.409 --> 00:15:48.119
would say that, you know, Homo sapiens was in

256
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.440
a variety of ecosystems and just like you're saying,

257
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:58.239
grasslands, savannas, rainforests and so on. So I, I

258
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.440
see us as a species that, which was able

259
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:06.179
to adapt to a variety of situations. Um But

260
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.380
that said, um in the past, you know, uh

261
00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.229
it, it's interesting in terms of the history of

262
00:16:12.239 --> 00:16:15.150
our field, people didn't pay too much attention to

263
00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:19.770
the specific environments in which say fossils or archaeology

264
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.880
was actually found, believe it or not. And so,

265
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:26.000
you know, environmental data was not actually even extracted

266
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.159
sometimes and people now do it in a standard

267
00:16:29.169 --> 00:16:32.260
way in terms of our research. But we are

268
00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.590
lacking a lot of information on the particular habitats

269
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.869
that Homo sapiens were actually adapting to. So, you

270
00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.260
know, that's, that's a bit of a problem. But,

271
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.969
but nevertheless, I, I do think that there are

272
00:16:45.979 --> 00:16:49.640
a wide array of ecosystems that sapiens was, was

273
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.169
in. Mhm. And that was different perhaps for other

274
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:56.380
species of, of hominins. And so that, you know,

275
00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.919
our versatility, our flexibility, our, our, you know, our

276
00:17:00.929 --> 00:17:05.329
array of adaptations that we have, you know, arose

277
00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:09.189
really in early forms of Homo sapiens. And so,

278
00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.829
you know, we're able to get in every ecosystem

279
00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:16.779
of the world eventually, right. So, so that flexibility

280
00:17:16.788 --> 00:17:20.328
really, you know, started, you know, early on in

281
00:17:20.338 --> 00:17:22.578
our, in our own species uh evolution.

282
00:17:23.098 --> 00:17:27.089
Mhm A and when it comes to the dispersal

283
00:17:27.098 --> 00:17:30.319
of Homo sapiens, I mean, we like to talk

284
00:17:30.329 --> 00:17:34.800
a lot about how to Africa migrations, but even

285
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:39.359
within Africa, there should be a rich history of

286
00:17:39.369 --> 00:17:46.040
population movement, interaction between populations and also sometimes probably

287
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.040
replacement. Right.

288
00:17:49.339 --> 00:17:53.020
Yeah. And you know, the actual on the ground

289
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:58.680
evidence for actually proving dispersal within Africa um or

290
00:17:58.689 --> 00:18:02.500
population connections is, is is difficult because sometimes you

291
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.089
have, you know, you have arguments interpretations about the

292
00:18:06.099 --> 00:18:10.290
data that you actually have. And so uh there

293
00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.329
are arguments for dispersal within Africa, certainly in a

294
00:18:14.339 --> 00:18:17.010
place like um you know, if you think about

295
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.180
the Sahara, you know, Sahara is of course a

296
00:18:20.189 --> 00:18:24.560
very hyper arid uh environment today. But when you

297
00:18:24.569 --> 00:18:27.630
look for the archaeology and the fossils, they're there

298
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:31.219
in those what are now hyper arid deserts. But

299
00:18:31.229 --> 00:18:35.069
when, when, when people were there, it was, you

300
00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:37.449
know, a green Sahara. So there, you know, there

301
00:18:37.459 --> 00:18:42.536
were and grasslands and networks of rivers and lakes

302
00:18:42.546 --> 00:18:47.765
and lakes, right? So populations would have been attracted

303
00:18:47.776 --> 00:18:52.855
to those environments during ameliorated periods and moved north,

304
00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:55.776
right? But when it got hyper arid again, you

305
00:18:55.786 --> 00:18:58.965
know, through those fluctuations through time, populations would have

306
00:18:58.975 --> 00:19:03.332
contracted or moved south. So you obviously are getting

307
00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:08.192
movements even within Africa of populations as a product

308
00:19:08.202 --> 00:19:12.712
of you know, changes of habitats and environments, right.

309
00:19:12.722 --> 00:19:15.411
So we, we can see that, um and, you

310
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:18.942
know, we also know there are interactions between populations.

311
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:22.161
So for instance, like obsidian, a type of rock

312
00:19:22.171 --> 00:19:25.251
that are, that's, that's found where artifacts were made

313
00:19:25.261 --> 00:19:30.880
from sometimes are, you know, 3, 400 kilometers distance

314
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.489
from its sources, right? And so there are arguments

315
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.569
that hunter gatherers were already involved in trade and

316
00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:42.859
exchange networks to, uh you know, exchange a a,

317
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.989
you know, a very special raw material like obsidian

318
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.239
uh down the line. And so we can see

319
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.729
that in, in, in the archaeological record and even

320
00:19:53.739 --> 00:19:57.800
things like beads. There's arguments that populations in Eastern

321
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.569
Africa were connected to those in southern Africa in

322
00:20:00.579 --> 00:20:04.810
terms of, you know, movement of styles of beads

323
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.170
and then those sort of bead forms change through

324
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.079
time where you perhaps you get more isolation of

325
00:20:12.089 --> 00:20:18.520
populations and identity and traditions forming within, within regions.

326
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.599
Mhm. So before we get into out of Africa

327
00:20:23.609 --> 00:20:26.589
migrations, I would like to ask you a couple

328
00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:32.189
of questions about certain changes that probably occurred with

329
00:20:32.199 --> 00:20:35.349
the advent of Homo Sapiens, we can discuss that

330
00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:39.880
uh that probably played an important role in allowing

331
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:45.319
for those migrations to occur. So, were there technological

332
00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:50.819
changes with Homo Sapiens? And if so how important

333
00:20:50.829 --> 00:20:52.160
were they?

334
00:20:53.219 --> 00:20:56.530
Well, there are very important technological changes with Homo

335
00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:59.599
sapiens. So, you know, I described earlier like Homo

336
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.729
hydro Gansas was using these large hand axes and

337
00:21:03.739 --> 00:21:07.800
cleavers. These are handheld forms for butchery. Uh BUT

338
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.479
they're handheld, right. And they're what we call a

339
00:21:10.819 --> 00:21:14.709
Shian tool kits. But with Sapiens, uh you know,

340
00:21:14.719 --> 00:21:19.109
the, the time period coincides with a transition from

341
00:21:19.119 --> 00:21:22.630
these large hand axes and cleavers to what we

342
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.224
call middle stone age technology. And so you get

343
00:21:26.234 --> 00:21:29.415
a tran transition to what are called these prepared

344
00:21:29.425 --> 00:21:34.574
co cores and Lavalo technologies where you get cores

345
00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:37.594
and flake tools, you get flake tools, they're small

346
00:21:37.604 --> 00:21:41.994
little flakes that are used to perhaps for cutting

347
00:21:42.005 --> 00:21:46.714
or scraping. But these, these, these, these uh flakes

348
00:21:46.724 --> 00:21:50.555
could also be um pro made into points as

349
00:21:50.564 --> 00:21:54.689
well. And these points could have been hefted onto

350
00:21:54.699 --> 00:21:57.810
handles like spears. And so all of a sudden

351
00:21:57.819 --> 00:22:01.949
you get the development of spear technology using a,

352
00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:05.130
you know, a, a very sharp implement which is

353
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.969
tipping that spear in order to more efficiently hunt

354
00:22:09.979 --> 00:22:13.729
animals. So you go from handheld technologies which Heidel

355
00:22:13.939 --> 00:22:18.540
Briens was using to, you know, technologies like the

356
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:22.520
spear, for instance, that Sapiens seemed to be routinely

357
00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:23.800
using early on.

358
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:30.530
Mhm And, and what is the evidence for symbolism

359
00:22:30.729 --> 00:22:35.339
in, in early Homo Sapiens? And what sort of,

360
00:22:35.349 --> 00:22:40.089
what can we deduce, let's say about our cognition

361
00:22:40.099 --> 00:22:41.839
through symbolism?

362
00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:45.640
Yes. So, so, you know, with Homo Sapiens, as

363
00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.170
I was saying earlier, you get larger brain sizes,

364
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.140
right? So there's obviously selection for a larger and

365
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.869
larger brain which of course, the inference there is

366
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.790
that you get a more advanced cognitive species, a

367
00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.400
more intelligent species, one that could plan ahead, for

368
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:06.189
example, and lo and behold, symbolism really starts to

369
00:23:06.199 --> 00:23:09.849
increase after 300,000 years ago. So a site like

370
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:15.229
a logo in Kenya has produced evidence of what,

371
00:23:15.239 --> 00:23:18.430
what are interpreted as symbolic forms of artifacts at

372
00:23:18.439 --> 00:23:23.300
320,000 years ago. And so for instance, there are

373
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:27.359
black and and white rocks that are being used

374
00:23:27.369 --> 00:23:31.170
that are imported for hundreds of kilometers away. And

375
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:35.239
there seems to be selection for colorful uh implements,

376
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.270
so colorful rocks in order to make implements, but

377
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.380
they're also engraved pieces of ochre, uh both red

378
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:46.430
and black ochre, which are thought to be used

379
00:23:46.439 --> 00:23:50.439
for perhaps color coloring agents, perhaps even to adorn

380
00:23:50.449 --> 00:23:53.390
the body. And so that these are thought to

381
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.969
be symbolic forms of artifacts 300,000 years ago. And

382
00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:02.709
then, you know, as time marches on you continue

383
00:24:02.719 --> 00:24:05.859
to get that, but certainly after 100,000 years ago,

384
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:08.579
you know, there's almost an explosion of things that

385
00:24:08.589 --> 00:24:11.729
we would call symbolic, you know, ochre becomes very

386
00:24:11.739 --> 00:24:16.005
common in the archaeological, right? And again that, you

387
00:24:16.015 --> 00:24:18.795
know, a lot of populations are using that and

388
00:24:18.805 --> 00:24:21.875
it may be that, you know, uh all these

389
00:24:21.885 --> 00:24:25.185
populations are across Africa are behaving in a very

390
00:24:25.224 --> 00:24:30.094
advanced way with respect to, you know, adorning their

391
00:24:30.104 --> 00:24:34.935
bodies, calling out their, you know, regional traditions or

392
00:24:34.944 --> 00:24:39.839
even individuality. Uh So these symbolic artifacts can be,

393
00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:44.219
you know, used as um used to interpret that

394
00:24:44.229 --> 00:24:45.030
kind of thing.

395
00:24:46.089 --> 00:24:51.640
Uh But what does symbolism tell us about our,

396
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:57.140
about our cognition and perhaps also about our sociality?

397
00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.689
I mean, how much information can we derive from

398
00:25:01.699 --> 00:25:02.869
that basically?

399
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.989
Well, again, these are difficult things in terms of

400
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.069
interpretation and you really have to be grounded in

401
00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:12.250
the evidence for it. And so sometimes it's not

402
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.189
easy and straightforward to interpret, but interpretations have been

403
00:25:17.199 --> 00:25:20.189
made uh about some of these things. And you

404
00:25:20.199 --> 00:25:23.369
know, it makes sense with respect to an increasing

405
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.829
brain size that you would get uh you know,

406
00:25:26.119 --> 00:25:30.329
uh advanced planning and symbolism arising, you know, brain

407
00:25:30.339 --> 00:25:32.949
sizes start to get as a, you know, as,

408
00:25:32.959 --> 00:25:36.750
as advanced as our brain sizes today, right? So,

409
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.329
so it would make sense just generally speaking that,

410
00:25:40.339 --> 00:25:44.180
you know, the these are very complex, uh you

411
00:25:44.189 --> 00:25:47.670
know, individuals and societies and you also start to

412
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.790
get variation in technologies across Africa. So you start

413
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:58.369
to get regionalization of technologies of symbolic forms and

414
00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:02.020
almost like the, you know, cultures are arising something

415
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.170
of course, very familiar to us today. You get

416
00:26:05.189 --> 00:26:10.430
a lot of heterogeneity in artifact forms. And so,

417
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.810
you know, these are traditions that have a lot

418
00:26:12.819 --> 00:26:16.219
of variation across Africa, just like it that we

419
00:26:16.229 --> 00:26:19.390
see today before this time, you didn't see those

420
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.489
kinds of things happening. So it seems to that,

421
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.099
you know, you get traditions for forming social networks

422
00:26:26.109 --> 00:26:30.300
forming identity forming, you know, all across Africa.

423
00:26:31.349 --> 00:26:34.579
Mhm. And I would imagine that all of these

424
00:26:34.589 --> 00:26:42.280
aspects, namely technological developments, cognitive evolution, uh evolution in

425
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:46.739
terms of our sociality, social networks, identities and so

426
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:51.500
on, all played an important role in the success

427
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:56.199
of our out of Africa migration. And uh we're

428
00:26:56.209 --> 00:27:02.089
being able to migrate across such a wide array

429
00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:04.520
of environments, right? Uh

430
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.040
I'd say the answer to that is yes and

431
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.670
no, because yes, in the sense that yes, I

432
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.810
do think that, you know, social networks are forming.

433
00:27:14.209 --> 00:27:17.390
Um And, you know, social networks are in fact,

434
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.689
very important in terms of, you know, being able

435
00:27:20.699 --> 00:27:24.989
to um you know, help each other within societies,

436
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.729
but also helping other groups that may be in

437
00:27:27.739 --> 00:27:32.010
trouble, for example, from environmental stress or other pressures,

438
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.689
right? So social networks help you to enhance survivability.

439
00:27:37.219 --> 00:27:39.479
And, you know, if you're thinking about, you know,

440
00:27:39.489 --> 00:27:45.550
migrations, strong social networks obviously ha help in terms

441
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.790
of populations getting into risky environments, for example, right.

442
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:54.969
So your survivability chances increases. However, we know the

443
00:27:54.979 --> 00:27:58.099
first dispersal's out of Africa. So, you know, they

444
00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:01.300
were experiments in some ways, you know, populations were,

445
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.819
in fact, you know, very advanced, both technologically and

446
00:28:04.829 --> 00:28:08.109
socially, but we also know that they were moving

447
00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:10.859
out of Africa, but they were not moving, you

448
00:28:10.869 --> 00:28:14.689
know, in permanent ways. And so there were a

449
00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:19.160
lot of migrations out of Africa, but those populations

450
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:23.650
didn't necessarily carry on over long periods of time.

451
00:28:23.739 --> 00:28:28.760
So, populations, you know, came, ee either sort of

452
00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.589
retreated in a sense, going back to Africa only

453
00:28:32.599 --> 00:28:35.579
to come out of Africa again and again and

454
00:28:35.589 --> 00:28:39.130
again. So, even though the early social networks might

455
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:44.359
have been forming, they weren't necessarily strong enough yet

456
00:28:44.579 --> 00:28:48.369
to allow populations just simply to migrate all across

457
00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:48.939
the world.

458
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:54.109
Mhm. And, I mean, we know that, uh, of

459
00:28:54.119 --> 00:28:57.199
course, evolutionarily speaking, it's not a long time at

460
00:28:57.209 --> 00:29:00.479
all. But, uh, uh, since we got out of

461
00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:02.510
Africa and we're going to get into that in

462
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.369
a second. But, uh, and spread across the Arabian

463
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:11.989
Peninsula, Southern Asia Europe and then even to the

464
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.339
Americas, it took perhaps tens of thousands of years.

465
00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:18.390
Right. Right.

466
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.630
Yes, absolutely. Um, BUT, yeah, I mean, we can

467
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.650
talk about that relative to, uh, you know, what

468
00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:27.849
we think about out, out of Africa, both in

469
00:29:27.859 --> 00:29:31.800
the past and today because interpretations are in fact,

470
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.219
quite different, you know. Um,

471
00:29:34.689 --> 00:29:37.390
OK, so le let's get into that then. So

472
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:41.170
when we talk about Homo Sapiens migrating out of

473
00:29:41.229 --> 00:29:46.530
Africa, when exactly did it first occur? And I

474
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.209
mean, when we talk about out of Africa migrations,

475
00:29:50.219 --> 00:29:54.189
I would imagine that perhaps it wasn't one single

476
00:29:54.199 --> 00:29:59.390
migration but multiple migrations and the cross, perhaps different

477
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.300
periods of time or not.

478
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.810
Yes. Well, listen, our theories about this have changed

479
00:30:04.819 --> 00:30:07.550
over the last 20 years, what I taught 20

480
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.579
years ago are far different than what I would

481
00:30:10.589 --> 00:30:14.000
teach today. And so, you know, this is where,

482
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.869
you know, we've really improved the evidence for interpreting

483
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.859
out of Africa migrations. So when I used to

484
00:30:20.869 --> 00:30:23.939
teach at Cambridge 20 years ago, we used to

485
00:30:23.949 --> 00:30:27.459
argue, you know, argue that there was one single

486
00:30:27.469 --> 00:30:30.729
migration out of Africa that was successful at 60,000

487
00:30:30.739 --> 00:30:34.469
years ago. Today, I would say that there were

488
00:30:34.479 --> 00:30:38.900
multiple migrations out of Africa that started 200,000 years

489
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.410
ago. And there were many out of Africa events

490
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.000
over time. And it just so happened that, you

491
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.579
know, in the last 60,000 years ago, perhaps the

492
00:30:48.589 --> 00:30:53.469
most sort of biologically successful migration if you will

493
00:30:53.479 --> 00:30:56.810
happen later on in time. But there were many

494
00:30:56.819 --> 00:31:00.130
migrations out of Africa starting at least 200,000 years

495
00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.550
ago. We didn't know that until recently. So, and

496
00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.339
that's because of improvements in dating the fossil evidence,

497
00:31:08.349 --> 00:31:11.449
the archaeological evidence has really come to bear in

498
00:31:11.459 --> 00:31:13.910
recent years on this. So, so we have a

499
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.650
big re sculpting of how, how we think about

500
00:31:17.699 --> 00:31:20.560
migration. So e even with respect to our own

501
00:31:20.569 --> 00:31:22.489
species uh today.

502
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.290
Yeah, because uh I mean, uh I, I've heard

503
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:32.439
a lot about this sort of more simplistic history

504
00:31:32.449 --> 00:31:36.939
of our out of Africa migrations where it supposedly

505
00:31:36.949 --> 00:31:42.959
started happening. I don't know, 60,000, 75,000 years ago.

506
00:31:43.089 --> 00:31:46.430
And then we went across Asia and Europe and

507
00:31:46.439 --> 00:31:49.574
then as I said into the Americas and we

508
00:31:49.584 --> 00:31:55.775
arrived at South America perhaps 15,000, 20 15,000 years

509
00:31:55.785 --> 00:31:59.364
ago. And then, and then there's the chronology about

510
00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:03.875
how we got into each place across Asia, for

511
00:32:03.885 --> 00:32:06.744
example, and then into the Americas. But that's perhaps

512
00:32:06.755 --> 00:32:09.185
too simplistic by now, right? It

513
00:32:09.415 --> 00:32:13.175
is simplistic now, but it was the consensus view.

514
00:32:13.479 --> 00:32:16.939
I mean, because there were many articles in nature

515
00:32:16.949 --> 00:32:21.660
and science, one after the other to reinforce that

516
00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.800
consensus view, I mean, there were many articles about

517
00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:29.619
this both from DNA archaeology, fossil evidence to argue

518
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:36.719
for one single migration 60,000 years ago, utilizing coastlines.

519
00:32:36.959 --> 00:32:39.400
And that was the consensus view of it was

520
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:44.010
a very strong hypothesis except that the evidence for

521
00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:48.670
it was, you know, fairly weak. Um YOU know,

522
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.640
it was mostly coming out of DNA and DNA

523
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:57.040
using modern populations, contemporary populations. Once ancient DNA started

524
00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.290
to come in to the forefront, the, you know,

525
00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.219
the the genetics world changed in terms of interpretation

526
00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:08.969
of that information. Um But also fossil, the fossil

527
00:33:08.979 --> 00:33:12.150
evidence has improved dramatically over the last decade or

528
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.930
so. And so we can actually see fossils were

529
00:33:14.939 --> 00:33:18.750
comfortable calling Homo sapiens in, you know, in, in

530
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:24.829
eastern Europe, in the Levant uh in Arabia that

531
00:33:24.839 --> 00:33:30.469
clearly indicate earlier dispersal uh and they are not

532
00:33:30.479 --> 00:33:35.640
coastal at all. So even though the coastal model

533
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.750
was the prevailing model that, you know, for instance,

534
00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:42.050
it was not a shred of evidence for the

535
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.390
coastal models. So there used to be an argument,

536
00:33:44.489 --> 00:33:48.380
you know, populations were coastal from South Africa. They

537
00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:51.859
went all along the coast of Africa, all outside

538
00:33:51.869 --> 00:33:56.500
of Africa, across Arabia, across India and eventually got

539
00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:01.540
into Australia, utilizing the coasts and boats, except that

540
00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.819
there was no evidence for it and there still

541
00:34:03.829 --> 00:34:07.140
isn't, there's no good evidence for a coastal dispersal.

542
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.409
Um But what we did, for instance, in a,

543
00:34:10.418 --> 00:34:15.379
in Arabia was we did surveys in terrestrial, inland

544
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:19.659
zones of Arabia and there is plenty of evidence

545
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:24.040
for dispersal inside Arabia. And, and it used to

546
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.938
be, they used, people used to think they were

547
00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:30.649
avoiding Arabia because it was a hyper arid zone.

548
00:34:30.958 --> 00:34:33.699
But people weren't really thinking of a green Arabia

549
00:34:33.708 --> 00:34:36.270
where hunter gathers would be very happy in a

550
00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.520
green Arabia living along rivers and lakes, right? So

551
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.728
they used to think, oh, they were side skirting

552
00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:47.100
Arabia by us utilizing coasts 60,000 years ago. But

553
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.540
now we know Homo Sapiens was in Arabia by

554
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.219
90,000 years ago because we have fossils and we

555
00:34:53.228 --> 00:34:57.479
have archaeology inside the middle of Arabia. So, so

556
00:34:57.489 --> 00:35:02.040
the arguments for, you know, a rapid single migration

557
00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:05.959
utilizing coast 60,000 years ago is out out of

558
00:35:05.969 --> 00:35:07.199
the window. I would say,

559
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.879
uh there's perhaps uh uh I mean, I'm not

560
00:35:10.889 --> 00:35:13.780
sure if, what I'm about to say is 100%

561
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.080
correct or not. And if not, please correct me,

562
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.500
but it seems to me that in terms of

563
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:25.399
Southern uh Asia. It's also been a little bit

564
00:35:25.409 --> 00:35:28.330
uh neglected, at least to some extent in terms

565
00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:32.024
of studying uh human evolution and, and these parcels,

566
00:35:32.034 --> 00:35:34.794
I mean, I, I hope that uh next year

567
00:35:34.804 --> 00:35:38.054
I will have Doctor Sheila Ere on the show

568
00:35:38.064 --> 00:35:40.044
and because she's done a lot of work on

569
00:35:40.054 --> 00:35:43.044
that, but I, it seems to me that at

570
00:35:43.054 --> 00:35:46.445
least to some extent it's been a depth uh

571
00:35:46.455 --> 00:35:49.564
area of the globe has been a little bit

572
00:35:49.574 --> 00:35:52.155
uh neglected historically, at least I would

573
00:35:52.165 --> 00:35:57.169
say absolutely true because um you know, we have

574
00:35:57.179 --> 00:36:01.320
huge biases in human evolutionary studies. There are big

575
00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:04.739
ge geographic biases in the way in which science

576
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:07.929
is done. And so you will find hundreds of

577
00:36:07.939 --> 00:36:11.800
pro projects happening in Europe today, but you will

578
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:15.679
find only a few dozen were uh active in

579
00:36:15.689 --> 00:36:19.739
Southern Asia, for example. Now, so you still get

580
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:23.209
huge biases in just the number of people dedicating

581
00:36:23.219 --> 00:36:26.580
all their time and energy to certain geographic areas

582
00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:30.000
in the world. You also get a huge difference

583
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:33.095
in the the amount of application of science done

584
00:36:33.105 --> 00:36:35.976
as well. Not only the amount of work, but

585
00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:39.946
you know, there are thousands of dates from Europe

586
00:36:39.956 --> 00:36:43.335
on archaeological sites. There are only hundreds of dates

587
00:36:43.345 --> 00:36:45.756
available in some other parts of the world like

588
00:36:45.766 --> 00:36:50.716
Arabia and India. So you're dealing with gigantic disparities

589
00:36:50.926 --> 00:36:53.751
in terms of the evidence out there. But it

590
00:36:53.761 --> 00:36:58.152
doesn't mean that for instance, the archaeological record of

591
00:36:58.162 --> 00:37:01.902
places like Arabia and India aren't rich because they

592
00:37:01.912 --> 00:37:06.481
are, there are many hundreds, if not thousands of

593
00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:09.961
paleolithic sites in these regions. It's just that the

594
00:37:09.971 --> 00:37:13.441
hard work and the many decades of research have

595
00:37:13.451 --> 00:37:17.352
not been done. So we do have geographic biases

596
00:37:17.362 --> 00:37:19.481
in the way in which we tell stories about

597
00:37:19.491 --> 00:37:22.219
out of Africa, even because of the amount of

598
00:37:22.229 --> 00:37:25.149
evidence that we actually have. So I've been very

599
00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:27.979
lucky over the years because I have had projects

600
00:37:27.989 --> 00:37:32.489
in India and Sri Lanka, Arabia and doing those

601
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.100
projects has been very wonderful because they've been huge

602
00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.969
opportunities. And every single time you go to the

603
00:37:37.979 --> 00:37:41.899
field, major discoveries are made. That's because we, this

604
00:37:41.909 --> 00:37:45.860
kind of research is almost pioneering because very few

605
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.489
projects are actually happening in terms of dedicated field

606
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.110
work. And so our fossil evidence isn't as great.

607
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.659
Our archaeological evidence in terms of publications isn't as

608
00:37:56.669 --> 00:38:00.110
great compared to other parts of the world. So,

609
00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:03.685
so yes, I mean, definitely there are biases in

610
00:38:03.695 --> 00:38:05.705
the way in which we tell the story, but

611
00:38:05.715 --> 00:38:08.225
I can tell you like we tested the coastal

612
00:38:08.235 --> 00:38:10.864
model and that was very easy to test and

613
00:38:10.875 --> 00:38:13.645
we found it, we falsified it almost right away

614
00:38:13.655 --> 00:38:17.064
because we saw there were plenty of sites that

615
00:38:17.074 --> 00:38:20.125
we could date to many periods of time which

616
00:38:20.135 --> 00:38:24.364
we thought represented Homo sapiens in interior zones. And

617
00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:28.205
so, ok, maybe coasts were used but not exclusively.

618
00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.070
And so it's important to work in, in all

619
00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.649
parts of the world and I would, you know,

620
00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:36.000
I say that all the time that we really

621
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.229
need to give even coverage to different parts of

622
00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:41.629
the world, the big chunks of Africa that are

623
00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:44.169
really understudied, for example.

624
00:38:44.649 --> 00:38:49.030
Mhm. And about the, the coastal model just to

625
00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.709
talk a little bit more about it. You mentioned

626
00:38:51.719 --> 00:38:55.489
that it was based mostly on ancient DNA and

627
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.000
also to some extent on the DNA

628
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.580
actually more like not ancient DNA

629
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.929
but, 000, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So sorry. Yeah. Yeah.

630
00:39:03.939 --> 00:39:05.179
Yeah. Yeah, actually.

631
00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.544
Right. Yeah. I mean, that's an important point because

632
00:39:09.554 --> 00:39:11.834
there was no ancient DNA that there still is

633
00:39:11.844 --> 00:39:16.524
hardly any ancient DNA. So you're using contemporary populations

634
00:39:16.534 --> 00:39:19.344
in this geographic space in order to tell a

635
00:39:19.354 --> 00:39:24.024
story about how rapidly populations may have been expanding

636
00:39:24.034 --> 00:39:26.504
out of Africa. And there's an argument that they

637
00:39:26.514 --> 00:39:31.334
expanded rapidly, therefore they were using boats, but there's

638
00:39:31.344 --> 00:39:35.159
no evidence of boats nor coastal sites. Ok.

639
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:39.459
Yeah. But, uh, uh uh, no. Yeah, I, I

640
00:39:39.469 --> 00:39:44.449
got it wrong. Sorry. So, um, it, so it

641
00:39:44.459 --> 00:39:47.209
was DNA and then you mentioned also the fact

642
00:39:47.219 --> 00:39:50.489
that people tend to tend to think that the

643
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.010
interior of, uh Arabia was arid as it is

644
00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:59.350
mostly nowadays. But we now know that it wasn't,

645
00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:02.659
but was there any other point to that sort

646
00:40:02.669 --> 00:40:06.879
of rationale? Like, for example, did people think that

647
00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:12.300
the movement was mostly coastal because coastal populations tend

648
00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:16.689
to have access to particular resources or,

649
00:40:17.189 --> 00:40:19.070
yeah, I mean, you could go to the coastal

650
00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.850
hypothesis and people are still arguing for coastal, uh

651
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:27.120
uh you know, dispersal and the arguments are that

652
00:40:27.129 --> 00:40:30.800
coasts are, you know, particular types of uh uh

653
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:35.300
habitats which could support populations in terms of, you

654
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.770
know, marine resources and near coastal resources in terms

655
00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.600
of shellfish. And so there's an abundant supply of

656
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:45.812
that kind of, you know, um bio. Uh SO,

657
00:40:45.982 --> 00:40:48.772
uh you know, there are arguments for this and

658
00:40:48.782 --> 00:40:51.883
the coasts are easy sort of corridors to be

659
00:40:51.893 --> 00:40:56.343
moving along and such. So, so there's arguments that,

660
00:40:56.403 --> 00:41:00.083
you know, populations would have naturally followed coastlines out

661
00:41:00.093 --> 00:41:04.232
of Africa, right, once they developed boating technology and

662
00:41:04.242 --> 00:41:07.113
things like this. So, so there are arguments for

663
00:41:07.123 --> 00:41:11.072
it. There is even n nutritional arguments that, you

664
00:41:11.083 --> 00:41:14.365
know, the the kind of proteins found in, in

665
00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:17.555
marine resources are good for brain development and such.

666
00:41:17.565 --> 00:41:20.615
So, so there are arguments for all of this.

667
00:41:20.625 --> 00:41:22.775
It's just that the on the ground evidence for

668
00:41:22.785 --> 00:41:26.055
it is almost non existent in terms of coastal

669
00:41:26.065 --> 00:41:30.696
adaptations or actual evidence to prove dispersal.

670
00:41:31.406 --> 00:41:33.976
No, I I was just trying here to understand

671
00:41:33.986 --> 00:41:37.676
the re the full rationale that people l for

672
00:41:37.686 --> 00:41:39.436
that kind of argument

673
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.649
and people still are arguing for that. But I

674
00:41:42.659 --> 00:41:45.320
would say that, you know, it was really popular

675
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:48.850
at one point. And you know, for me, you

676
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.580
know, what was really important is that surveys and

677
00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:57.145
research happened in the interior zones, in places you

678
00:41:57.155 --> 00:42:02.504
didn't expect sites, right. So, and they're there. So

679
00:42:02.514 --> 00:42:05.925
therefore, now you have to explain that and, and

680
00:42:05.935 --> 00:42:09.104
there's no way to talk about coastal dispersal when

681
00:42:09.114 --> 00:42:12.284
you have such an abundance of archaeology, for example,

682
00:42:12.294 --> 00:42:15.905
in interior zones. And, you know, hunter gatherers, as

683
00:42:15.915 --> 00:42:19.844
we know, like living along rivers, they like living

684
00:42:19.854 --> 00:42:22.419
a lot home lake. So, why not? I i

685
00:42:22.429 --> 00:42:25.699
it's just natural to that habitats for them. And

686
00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:28.120
that's where you find a lot of terrestrial biomass

687
00:42:28.219 --> 00:42:31.729
plants and animals are abundant. And so, you know,

688
00:42:31.739 --> 00:42:33.860
in these places, we used to think of as

689
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:39.209
stereotypically, you know, um bad places to be living.

690
00:42:39.699 --> 00:42:42.110
That's not the way they always were in the

691
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.780
past because we have, you know, people aren't thinking

692
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:49.860
about the fluctuations of environments a across the Pleistocene

693
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:53.649
over the last 300,000 years, right. So, and that's

694
00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:58.379
what's so important to really consider because those fluctuations

695
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.790
are maybe what drove dispersal and even drove our

696
00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.760
own evolution.

697
00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:07.659
Mhm. Yeah. A actually let me ask you a

698
00:43:07.669 --> 00:43:11.540
little bit about climate change. Now, we've studied, for

699
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:16.080
example, the Arabian Peninsula. So uh by studying human

700
00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:20.449
migration there, what can we learn about the effects

701
00:43:20.459 --> 00:43:23.629
that climate change have on human dispersal?

702
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.750
I would say climate change has had a gigantic

703
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.239
effect. Uh And in somewhere like the Sahara and

704
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:36.719
Arabia, you have very strong environment, environmental variability because

705
00:43:36.729 --> 00:43:40.520
rainfall is really changing the amount of rainfall that

706
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.879
you get really changes through time. So you get

707
00:43:44.199 --> 00:43:47.459
these big fluctuations in the amount of rainfall because

708
00:43:47.469 --> 00:43:51.729
of monsoon variability, for example, through time. And that's

709
00:43:51.739 --> 00:43:55.219
really important because if you have very little rainfall,

710
00:43:55.229 --> 00:43:58.239
as we know, you've got, you know, arid zones

711
00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:01.659
and even hyper arid zones, which are almost impossible

712
00:44:01.699 --> 00:44:03.719
to live in. Right. So if you go to

713
00:44:03.729 --> 00:44:06.780
the empty quarter today, you know, you'll die pretty

714
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:10.659
rapidly because there's no water sources available to you

715
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.689
and there's no grasses, there's no animals that you

716
00:44:14.699 --> 00:44:18.330
can be subsisting on. But when you had increased

717
00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:22.239
rainfall and this happened multiple times in the past,

718
00:44:22.409 --> 00:44:25.870
you get habitats that are forming that we are

719
00:44:25.879 --> 00:44:28.959
familiar with, like in, in eastern Africa today where

720
00:44:28.969 --> 00:44:32.530
you have that grasslands and savannahs and you get

721
00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:36.044
a lot of biomass, right? So hunter gatherers love

722
00:44:36.054 --> 00:44:40.104
those type of ecosystems. And Arabia, we have evidence

723
00:44:40.114 --> 00:44:43.685
for that. We have um done remote sensing of

724
00:44:43.695 --> 00:44:47.965
Arabia and our teams have actually demonstrated that there

725
00:44:47.975 --> 00:44:52.114
are up to 10,000 ancient lakes of Arabia, 10,000

726
00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:55.114
ancient lakes. And when we go to survey some

727
00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.854
of those lake, we've only surveyed two or 300

728
00:44:57.864 --> 00:45:02.159
of those lakes so far. And on 70% of

729
00:45:02.169 --> 00:45:07.310
those lakes, we have fossils or archaeology and that

730
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:11.580
means people were coming in there repeatedly through time.

731
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.120
And so we date those archaeological sites and we

732
00:45:14.129 --> 00:45:16.989
can see different ages of those sites, you know,

733
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.169
say 200,000 years ago, 100 25,000 years ago, 90

734
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.780
th 1000 years ago and so on. So we

735
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.419
know those lakes are coming and going and so

736
00:45:29.429 --> 00:45:34.820
populations are expanding, contracting and possibly either moving on

737
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.379
or going extinct when those habitats get really bad.

738
00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:43.239
Mhm. A and I guess that another thing that

739
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:47.239
we should consider here is, uh, I mean, thinking

740
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:51.330
again about the coastal hypothesis that is just focused

741
00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:55.820
on the southern coast of Asia. Basically, it's not

742
00:45:55.830 --> 00:46:00.524
that it's not all that we also dispersed within

743
00:46:00.534 --> 00:46:07.084
the Arabian Peninsula, but also across wider areas in

744
00:46:07.094 --> 00:46:10.364
Asia, right, like Central Asia and so on. And

745
00:46:10.375 --> 00:46:13.784
that's also another thing that we have to consider

746
00:46:13.794 --> 00:46:14.044
here.

747
00:46:14.669 --> 00:46:17.550
Absolutely. And so you have your northern roots, right?

748
00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.409
So you, you know, populations could be moving northwards

749
00:46:21.419 --> 00:46:24.409
as well, which I think they were. Uh AND

750
00:46:24.419 --> 00:46:27.149
we have evidence of that, of course. Um And

751
00:46:27.159 --> 00:46:30.429
so Homo Sapiens is getting into northern latitudes as

752
00:46:30.439 --> 00:46:34.100
well and those are all terrestrial movements, obviously. So,

753
00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.629
so, you know, I uh so this this sort

754
00:46:38.639 --> 00:46:41.770
of the mantra and the consensus that formed about

755
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:45.409
coastal hypotheses, you know, I think is, you know,

756
00:46:45.419 --> 00:46:49.280
because of the power of DNA and the power

757
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:52.830
of getting into all those high impact journals. Um

758
00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.239
And, you know, people's belief uh in terms of

759
00:46:55.250 --> 00:47:00.379
the arguments why coastal roots are fa what people

760
00:47:00.389 --> 00:47:04.419
believe are, are favorable habitats. Uh But I think

761
00:47:04.429 --> 00:47:08.479
that ignores 99% of the evidence that we actually

762
00:47:08.489 --> 00:47:09.030
have.

763
00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:16.530
Mhm. And what other ominous species did we interact

764
00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:20.889
with? Exactly. I mean, we know about neanderthals. Did

765
00:47:20.899 --> 00:47:23.850
we also interact with the NUBS? For

766
00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.449
example? Of course. So, you know, in some pop

767
00:47:26.459 --> 00:47:30.139
Eurasian populations today, there's any anywhere between like 1

768
00:47:30.149 --> 00:47:33.770
to 2% of Neanderthal DNA N today. So we

769
00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:38.120
know there were obvious interactions with Homo sapiens as

770
00:47:38.129 --> 00:47:42.260
they moved into habitats occupied by neanderthals. But as

771
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:45.870
they moved towards, you know, Eastern Asia, there certainly

772
00:47:45.879 --> 00:47:48.879
would have been encountering the, the dinoso ins and

773
00:47:48.889 --> 00:47:54.709
in some populations today, um uh denos ofin integrations

774
00:47:54.719 --> 00:47:58.685
is as high as 4 to 6% uh within

775
00:47:58.695 --> 00:48:02.445
some genomes. So, so, you know, there were, there's

776
00:48:02.455 --> 00:48:05.985
probably a lot of interaction going on with denisovans

777
00:48:05.995 --> 00:48:10.425
as we migrated into other habitats. It's also possible.

778
00:48:10.635 --> 00:48:13.364
Uh YOU know, there are these uh species, sometimes

779
00:48:13.375 --> 00:48:16.104
geneticists refer to them as ghost species. They're not

780
00:48:16.114 --> 00:48:19.945
quite sure with other species we may have encountered

781
00:48:19.955 --> 00:48:23.129
and interbred with. But you know, we know there

782
00:48:23.139 --> 00:48:26.979
are other species around in Asia, like homo fluoresces,

783
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:32.350
homo lua lenses and others um that are in

784
00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.149
Asia. But we don't know the degree to which

785
00:48:35.159 --> 00:48:40.370
sapiens was actually interbreeding and interacting with those species.

786
00:48:40.379 --> 00:48:43.580
But I wouldn't be surprised if, if there were

787
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:49.554
interactions with multiple forms uh of, of um ancestors

788
00:48:49.564 --> 00:48:52.145
as we spread around the world. You know, because

789
00:48:52.155 --> 00:48:55.745
also these, some of these populations these ancestral populations

790
00:48:55.774 --> 00:48:58.004
perhaps were not, you know, some of maybe quite

791
00:48:58.014 --> 00:49:01.074
large, but some could have been quite small that

792
00:49:01.084 --> 00:49:04.034
they were in isolated pockets of a uh of

793
00:49:04.044 --> 00:49:07.364
Asia. And once Homo sapiens, they, they may have

794
00:49:07.375 --> 00:49:10.145
been interacting to a certain degree but not a

795
00:49:10.155 --> 00:49:14.979
large degree, right. Um And so we get variations

796
00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:17.699
in the degree to which populations might have been

797
00:49:17.709 --> 00:49:19.199
interacting and interbreeding.

798
00:49:19.889 --> 00:49:23.610
Mhm. Uh WHICH is also very, a very interesting

799
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:26.709
aspect of our revolution. I mean, the fact that

800
00:49:26.719 --> 00:49:32.610
we interbred with Neanderthals, denisovans and possibly other species

801
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:36.070
because uh this also plays into some of what

802
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.989
we were talking about earlier when I for example,

803
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.979
mentioned the fact that uh it's complicated the way

804
00:49:42.989 --> 00:49:48.683
we classify uh uh certain species because traditionally, and

805
00:49:48.693 --> 00:49:54.022
I guess until recently, there was this very widespread

806
00:49:54.032 --> 00:49:58.613
definition of species where uh uh individuals would be

807
00:49:58.623 --> 00:50:01.363
part of the same species if they could uh

808
00:50:01.373 --> 00:50:07.762
reproduce among themselves and produce offspring. That would be

809
00:50:07.772 --> 00:50:10.845
uh for right? And I mean, in, in this

810
00:50:10.855 --> 00:50:14.726
case, since we are interbreeding with the nubs and

811
00:50:14.736 --> 00:50:18.406
neanderthals that are classified as other species, I mean,

812
00:50:18.416 --> 00:50:22.375
again, we get into this complicated discussion that is

813
00:50:22.385 --> 00:50:26.135
that is also a wider discussion in evolutionary biology

814
00:50:26.145 --> 00:50:28.635
about what the species is.

815
00:50:28.645 --> 00:50:32.236
Exactly. Yes. And a never ending debate, it seems

816
00:50:32.246 --> 00:50:32.595
to

817
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.419
uh OK. So uh but when it comes to

818
00:50:39.429 --> 00:50:43.689
the interactions we have, particularly with neanderthals, I mean,

819
00:50:43.699 --> 00:50:48.899
that, that that's another very big discussion about what

820
00:50:48.909 --> 00:50:53.159
led to the extinction of neanderthals. I mean, as

821
00:50:53.169 --> 00:50:56.800
far as we know, did we have anything to

822
00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.540
do with it? I mean, did we basically outcompete

823
00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:00.659
them or?

824
00:51:01.199 --> 00:51:04.199
I, I, again, these, you know, these are age

825
00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:07.290
old debates, right? Uh, IN terms of what drove

826
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:11.020
the neanderthals to extinction. But, but I mean, I'm,

827
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:15.189
I'm more supportive of arguments which really get into

828
00:51:15.199 --> 00:51:19.979
more demographic flux than anything rather than direct competition.

829
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.969
And I think, you know, neanderthals were around for

830
00:51:22.979 --> 00:51:26.290
a long time and it seems that there's, you

831
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.840
know, some good evidence that, you know, their effective

832
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:33.850
population sizes were decreasing uh over time and, you

833
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.889
know, they were dealing with a lot of, you

834
00:51:35.899 --> 00:51:39.500
know, environmental variability through time as well. And so

835
00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.800
there, there seemed to be some isolation of some

836
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:46.080
of these populations and like many species, you know,

837
00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:49.449
that many species obviously go extinct. And I don't,

838
00:51:49.459 --> 00:51:52.080
I see that more as a sort of a

839
00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:56.699
natural evolutionary um progression from the and tools than

840
00:51:56.709 --> 00:52:00.949
saying, you know, these arguments of aggression or direct

841
00:52:00.959 --> 00:52:05.340
contact and violence with, you know, Homo Sapiens driving

842
00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.389
them as a replacement model. I, you know, the

843
00:52:08.399 --> 00:52:11.540
evidence for, you know, uh for uh uh a

844
00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:16.929
sort of aggressive replacement is really almost nil I

845
00:52:16.939 --> 00:52:20.879
would say, in terms of sapiens and neanderthals, we've

846
00:52:20.889 --> 00:52:24.280
a very, you know, limited evidence to argue for

847
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:27.169
that. So, II I almost, you know, there are

848
00:52:27.179 --> 00:52:29.530
people like Clive Finlayson for a long time that

849
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:32.659
have been arguing for just demographic change in the

850
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:35.830
anatol populations and they, you know, ended up just

851
00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.479
sort of dying out naturally because of environmental flux

852
00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:43.000
and, and, and the way in which populations behave

853
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.840
over time.

854
00:52:44.489 --> 00:52:49.929
Mhm. So about still about human disposals across the

855
00:52:49.939 --> 00:52:53.469
globe. We've already talked here about how, so how

856
00:52:53.479 --> 00:52:56.969
certain areas of the globe, like Southern Asia are

857
00:52:56.979 --> 00:53:01.000
a bit understudied. But what would you say are

858
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:05.340
perhaps some of the big, just missing pieces in

859
00:53:05.350 --> 00:53:07.610
the way in what we know and the way

860
00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:12.580
we understand our Homo Sapiens spread across the globe

861
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:17.989
in Europe, Asia and then into Australia and the

862
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:18.909
Americas.

863
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.510
Yeah, there's so many questions. I mean, that's a,

864
00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.540
that's a big question because you're talking about a

865
00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:27.689
lot of geography, right? And so there's a lot

866
00:53:27.699 --> 00:53:29.949
of uh you know, I mean, we could sit

867
00:53:29.959 --> 00:53:32.219
here probably for an hour to talk about each

868
00:53:32.229 --> 00:53:34.010
one of those places and the, you know, the,

869
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.750
the variation that we see in the archaeological record

870
00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:39.580
even. And, but you know, listen, I mean, I'm

871
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:42.679
working on a couple projects right now like um

872
00:53:42.689 --> 00:53:44.959
in different parts of the world. And I'm very

873
00:53:44.969 --> 00:53:47.429
excited about some of the work we're doing uh

874
00:53:47.439 --> 00:53:50.469
in collaboration with the Chinese. And you know, there

875
00:53:50.479 --> 00:53:54.320
are some really interesting sites that are appearing in

876
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:57.879
China that are soon to be published, which talk

877
00:53:57.889 --> 00:54:02.870
about early dispersal to really northern latitudes. And so

878
00:54:02.879 --> 00:54:05.989
that's really interesting because we see, we, we think

879
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.300
we see very rapid dispersal of Homo sapiens anywhere

880
00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:16.209
between 50,000 to 45,000 years ago from perhaps like

881
00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:20.330
the Leon, you know, through to Russia, uh into

882
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:23.689
Mongolia and into China. And so this is part

883
00:54:23.699 --> 00:54:28.445
of like this very unknown kind of uh rapid

884
00:54:28.455 --> 00:54:33.205
movement of populations across vast territories. And we have

885
00:54:33.215 --> 00:54:37.034
some sites in China which are consistent with that.

886
00:54:37.185 --> 00:54:39.754
But it also complicating it because we have new

887
00:54:39.764 --> 00:54:44.014
dates which you know, that very sort of simplistic

888
00:54:44.024 --> 00:54:47.459
arrow that you might wanna draw from Laon, you

889
00:54:47.469 --> 00:54:50.510
know, to the, you know, through Russia down into

890
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:55.850
Mongolia, to China doesn't necessarily work because uh you

891
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:58.709
know, again, we're dealing with populations and it may

892
00:54:58.719 --> 00:55:02.149
be sort of mosaics going on, right, rather than

893
00:55:02.159 --> 00:55:05.510
one line of advance. And so, you know, it's

894
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.780
very possible some populations are going north, some are

895
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:12.100
going a little bit more southernly in latitudes and

896
00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:15.949
they're either interacting at times and some populations are

897
00:55:15.959 --> 00:55:19.800
going eastward earlier than others. So, you know, there's

898
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:22.550
a lot, a lot to consider there in terms

899
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:28.570
of terrain, timing of movements, interactions of populations. And

900
00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.879
so that's something that is really developing in terms

901
00:55:31.889 --> 00:55:35.870
of our knowledge about these movements across Northern Asia.

902
00:55:36.479 --> 00:55:40.300
Um But it's also probably consistent with a story

903
00:55:40.409 --> 00:55:43.370
that has emerged out of Europe for decades in

904
00:55:43.379 --> 00:55:45.810
terms of the meaning of the upper paleolithic the

905
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:50.080
movements into Europe like 45,000 years ago by Homo

906
00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:53.399
Sapiens. And so we're really learning about these movements

907
00:55:53.409 --> 00:55:56.459
in Northern Asia now. Uh And not a lot

908
00:55:56.469 --> 00:55:59.760
of work has been dedicated to that. So, so

909
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.979
that's something that's very exciting. And I have to

910
00:56:01.989 --> 00:56:05.669
say because III I, um um you know, I'm

911
00:56:05.679 --> 00:56:08.320
a, I'm, I'm a director of a Human Evolution

912
00:56:08.330 --> 00:56:12.090
Center here in Australia. Australia is an absolutely fascinating

913
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.260
place because, you know, the argument is that uh

914
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:19.790
indigenous people here uh represent the oldest culture of

915
00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.500
Homo sapiens in the world, you know, in the

916
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:26.189
sense that people got here at least 60 65,000

917
00:56:26.199 --> 00:56:30.110
years ago. And people survived over that period of

918
00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.340
time. It wasn't like there was a big demographic

919
00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:38.030
change, right? And what's so fascinating about Australia is

920
00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:41.500
that once people got here, they survived over long

921
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:46.929
periods of time without complete turnover or extinction. So

922
00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.320
people figured it out like they, they could actually

923
00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:53.719
um you know, weather the storm in terms of,

924
00:56:53.729 --> 00:56:58.159
you know, environmental variability. Uh AND they had really,

925
00:56:58.169 --> 00:57:01.360
you know, the, the, their, their, their sort of

926
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:05.560
the innovations that Australian people, the Australian Aborigines had

927
00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:09.120
were quite remarkable, uh the strong social networks that

928
00:57:09.129 --> 00:57:12.090
they had. So, um you know, in other places

929
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:14.719
of the world, we see big turnovers of populations,

930
00:57:14.729 --> 00:57:18.000
but not in Australia. Once people were here, they,

931
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:21.560
they were here continuously and they're still here. So,

932
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:23.199
you know, that's the sort of in a sense,

933
00:57:23.209 --> 00:57:26.879
the longest running culture in the world, in terms

934
00:57:26.889 --> 00:57:30.439
of when Homo Sapiens got to an unoccupied continent,

935
00:57:30.709 --> 00:57:34.149
they were stable in a sense. Um And so,

936
00:57:34.159 --> 00:57:36.810
you know, they, of course demographic changes and people

937
00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.090
moving around a lot, but, you know, they're long

938
00:57:40.110 --> 00:57:43.820
lasting. And that is fascinating to me because I'm

939
00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:48.780
very interested in um you know, looking at contemporary

940
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:52.699
issues in terms of, you know, um sort of

941
00:57:52.709 --> 00:57:57.594
ideas about like vulnerability and resilience to, you know,

942
00:57:57.604 --> 00:58:02.135
ecosystem change, for example, like even what we're experiencing

943
00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:04.604
in, in the world today. And I think, you

944
00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:07.334
know, somewhere like Australia is really, there's so many

945
00:58:07.344 --> 00:58:10.695
lessons to be had here in terms of how

946
00:58:10.705 --> 00:58:13.655
people dealt with that vulnerability and how they were

947
00:58:13.665 --> 00:58:17.955
resilient in the face of really, you know, gigantic

948
00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:21.574
environmental changes through time and they persisted through it,

949
00:58:21.715 --> 00:58:24.780
you know, so, so that really fascinates me in,

950
00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:28.139
in terms of telling a story, even about things

951
00:58:28.149 --> 00:58:30.300
that are of interest to us today,

952
00:58:31.489 --> 00:58:35.020
that actually makes a very good segue to my

953
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:40.570
last question. So, uh you're uh an anthropologist, so

954
00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:45.510
you study a lot, our human evolution, human past

955
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:48.969
do uh to what extent do you think lessons

956
00:58:48.979 --> 00:58:53.899
from the past? Tell us anything about humanity today?

957
00:58:53.909 --> 00:58:56.899
I mean, do you think that even as people

958
00:58:56.909 --> 00:59:02.290
who live in modern industrialized and post industrial societies

959
00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:08.780
can learn from some more traditional societies and even

960
00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:11.449
societies from the past.

961
00:59:12.449 --> 00:59:15.219
Yes, I, I absolutely think that we can learn

962
00:59:15.229 --> 00:59:17.389
a lot from the past and, you know, we

963
00:59:17.399 --> 00:59:19.320
are in a special moment. Like, listen, there are

964
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:21.810
8 billion of us in the world today. You

965
00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:25.459
know, the situation that we find ourselves in today

966
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:28.260
is unique in a sense like it's never existed

967
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:31.229
on this planet ever before. Right? So, so there

968
00:59:31.239 --> 00:59:34.675
are certain very special attributes about where we are

969
00:59:34.685 --> 00:59:38.064
in the contemporary world and where we're headed. But,

970
00:59:38.155 --> 00:59:41.725
you know, there is continuity in terms of what

971
00:59:41.735 --> 00:59:44.635
we experienced in the past as well. And in

972
00:59:44.645 --> 00:59:47.165
fact, I'm glad you asked that question because I'm

973
00:59:47.175 --> 00:59:51.495
actually working on a very massive project. Uh Right

974
00:59:51.504 --> 00:59:56.280
now, I'm building a consortium of interdisciplinary scholars within

975
00:59:56.290 --> 01:00:01.239
Australia, but also internationally to study exactly that. How

976
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.429
do we bridge the past with the present? And

977
01:00:04.439 --> 01:00:07.699
you know, there are many stories about resilience in

978
01:00:07.709 --> 01:00:12.600
the past, vulnerability in the past. Um And those

979
01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:16.840
stories and those lessons are definitely a bridge to,

980
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:19.550
to, to today, even though we find ourselves in

981
01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.479
a certain situation, there are many situations in the

982
01:00:23.489 --> 01:00:27.189
past that bear on uh the circumstances we have

983
01:00:27.199 --> 01:00:30.360
today. So there are analogies, there are lessons learned.

984
01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:33.370
And what I would like to do is bring

985
01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:37.770
those lessons out more and actually learn how to

986
01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:42.649
bridge past phenomena with present phenomena. Because, you know,

987
01:00:42.659 --> 01:00:45.169
when you talk to an archaeologist, for example, they're

988
01:00:45.179 --> 01:00:49.530
very uncomfortable sometimes bridging the past with the present,

989
01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.020
right? Because you're out of your comfort zone in

990
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:55.070
terms of being able to do that. But if

991
01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.729
you have dedicated research, which I intend to do

992
01:00:58.739 --> 01:01:03.290
with this consortium on that bridging, then we can

993
01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:05.689
put a lot of research into that. A lot

994
01:01:05.699 --> 01:01:08.600
of energy into that. And normally we don't do

995
01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:11.179
that. Like what we, what we do do is

996
01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:13.399
we do a lot of discovery science looking at

997
01:01:13.409 --> 01:01:18.100
the past but not really thinking about the relevance

998
01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:21.709
of it to today and the bridging arguments that

999
01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:25.030
you have to make to the contemporary world. So

1000
01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:29.290
I'm actually developing right now this consortium to do

1001
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.469
precisely that it's a very difficult thing to do.

1002
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.699
But I think, you know, we, we can do

1003
01:01:34.709 --> 01:01:36.530
it if we throw, you know, a lot of

1004
01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.620
interdisciplinary science at it and particular methods at looking

1005
01:01:40.629 --> 01:01:43.270
at past phenomena, present phenomenon.

1006
01:01:44.169 --> 01:01:49.419
Uh What what uh contemporary issues exactly are you

1007
01:01:49.429 --> 01:01:54.090
expecting to uh deal with? I mean, with that

1008
01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:58.699
kind of information, is it mostly climate change or

1009
01:01:58.709 --> 01:02:03.229
are there also other issues where that information would

1010
01:02:03.239 --> 01:02:04.139
apply to?

1011
01:02:04.989 --> 01:02:07.459
Well, very naturally, like almost the easiest thing to

1012
01:02:07.469 --> 01:02:10.770
do is actually look at climatic variability and how

1013
01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.919
do populations react in the past, how we're reacting

1014
01:02:13.929 --> 01:02:17.050
today? And that may give us some ideas about

1015
01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:20.590
mitigating the circumstances that we find ourselves in, right,

1016
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:23.010
in terms of lessons, tho those are the most

1017
01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:26.030
obvious ways to be looking at that. But also

1018
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.239
I think there were a lot of social, social

1019
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:31.679
issues too that we're in crisis, crisis mode and

1020
01:02:31.689 --> 01:02:34.290
in a lot of ways today, but the crises

1021
01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:37.580
that we're facing today are not unique to societies,

1022
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.949
societies in the past dealt with a lot with

1023
01:02:39.959 --> 01:02:43.330
a lot of different crises as well, both socially

1024
01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:46.780
and environmentally. And so I think again, we can,

1025
01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.330
you know, you, you, you brought up the word

1026
01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.429
anthropology, I think, you know, if we're sort of

1027
01:02:51.439 --> 01:02:54.250
anthropologists in the, in the contemporary scene in the

1028
01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.189
past, then, you know, we can, we can talk

1029
01:02:57.199 --> 01:02:59.820
about that bridging and, and how that works. So

1030
01:02:59.899 --> 01:03:01.800
I would say it's a little bit of everything,

1031
01:03:01.810 --> 01:03:05.350
the, the environments are, are the most obvious. But

1032
01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.489
I, I also think, you know, that people have

1033
01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:12.580
dealt with societal collapse, societal changes in the past.

1034
01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:15.919
Uh um And, and, you know, if we can

1035
01:03:15.929 --> 01:03:18.899
bring that out more, I, I think, you know,

1036
01:03:18.909 --> 01:03:21.739
other scholars will learn a lot more about what,

1037
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:25.520
you know, what happened in human history and even

1038
01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:28.790
in the deep time because people actually don't realize

1039
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.669
it as much. Uh And, and then the, the

1040
01:03:32.679 --> 01:03:35.469
key is like how to develop methods in order

1041
01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:39.100
to, you know, connect the past and the present.

1042
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.449
Mhm. Well, that sounds really fascinating. And uh just

1043
01:03:44.459 --> 01:03:47.330
before we go, would you like to tell people

1044
01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:50.389
where they can follow your work on the internet?

1045
01:03:51.739 --> 01:03:54.719
Well, yes. Um So, um you know, our Center,

1046
01:03:54.729 --> 01:03:57.489
uh the Australian Research Center for Human Evolution has

1047
01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:01.290
a dedicated website to uh my own research, but

1048
01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:04.080
also the group that I'm part of and you

1049
01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.459
know, we're part of also an international what network

1050
01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:08.500
of scholars. So if you go to that website,

1051
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:10.570
you can look up projects, you can look up

1052
01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.679
publications, you can look up research themes that I've

1053
01:04:13.689 --> 01:04:16.889
talked about uh today and you know, you can

1054
01:04:16.899 --> 01:04:19.709
go from there and, and, and click away.

1055
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:24.570
