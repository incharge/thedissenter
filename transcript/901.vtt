WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.850
Uh LOOK, I, I was, I was going to

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.719
ask you because uh I think that in one

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.530
of our conversations, we talked a little bit about

4
00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:11.439
this. But uh I was uh I was curious,

5
00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.569
I got curious the other day, um when you're,

6
00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.319
when you're in the process in the initial steps

7
00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.819
of creating a story, uh o of course, I

8
00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.809
don't want you to just leave on the table

9
00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.590
all your cards, all of the things that you

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.139
use as a, as a writer. I'm an open

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.750
book but I'll talk about anything. But uh uh

12
00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:40.310
uh how do you go about it exactly. I

13
00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.130
mean, because of course, I imagine that different writers,

14
00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:48.950
different artists have different methods, different processes. They go

15
00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:54.650
through different creative ways of uh building up their

16
00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.680
stories. But uh how do you do it exactly?

17
00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:01.299
I mean, uh perhaps not so much how you

18
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.720
do it but uh how much of it do

19
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.449
you plan ahead? So you, uh for example, you

20
00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:11.629
have an idea for a story before you start

21
00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:15.800
writing. Do you already have a detailed plan about

22
00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:19.739
uh the characters that you will have their, their

23
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.319
personalities, their names the places where the story will

24
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.250
take place, the ending or how do you go

25
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.599
about

26
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.550
it? I used to not, first of all, what

27
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.760
you're talking about is there are two kinds of

28
00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:39.410
writers, they say plotters and panthers, plotters plot, right?

29
00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:41.330
And panthers fly by the seat of their pants.

30
00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:43.660
I used to be a panther and because I,

31
00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:47.360
I felt like, I don't know, II, I like

32
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.580
that feeling of kind of winging it and seeing

33
00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:53.300
where the story took me. And then I, um

34
00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:55.879
I wrote an outline for one of my novels

35
00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:58.339
and by outline, I didn't kind of, I didn't

36
00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.440
really write a classical outline. In fact, I didn't

37
00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:03.220
even start out trying to write an outline. I

38
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.349
was just trying to think through, I knew I

39
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.699
wanted to tell a certain story and I was

40
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.080
trying to think through how I would get from

41
00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:13.850
one part of the story to the next. And

42
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.710
so what I began doing was um writing a

43
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.800
chapter, giving the chapter a name. I didn't always

44
00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.500
give the chapter a name first. Sometimes I, I

45
00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.050
wrote a short summary of it first. I would

46
00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:29.320
just write a short summary, basically what I wanted

47
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.470
to happen in that chapter. And so that's how

48
00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:39.190
I've settled on writing an outline that to, to

49
00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:41.630
put it more into a narrative, you know, to

50
00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.809
put my outline into a, into prose, you know,

51
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.190
into a, into an actual functioning narrative works better

52
00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.949
for me than writing the, the sort of classical

53
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.080
outline of, you know, the chapter one a is

54
00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:58.429
going to happen, the protagonist meets the heroine, they

55
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.479
go on a motorcycle ride, you know, that, that

56
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.419
doesn't work for me. It doesn't, it doesn't inspire

57
00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:09.479
me sufficiently to wanna write to that direct, you

58
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.990
know, to that chapter. So, you know, sometimes if

59
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.100
I write a relatively short summary, that's maybe just

60
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.559
a paragraph. Other times, I even, you know, if

61
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.220
I feel moved, I'll write an entire scene from

62
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.360
that, you know, as it kind of comes to

63
00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.429
me, not perfect obviously, but just maybe a few

64
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.759
lines of dialogue, whatever it is. And that has

65
00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:35.830
been really helpful to me. So now I think

66
00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:41.720
I'm an official plotter because I, um not only

67
00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.330
does that expedite the process tremendously, it, it just

68
00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:47.899
makes it so much easier to write. It also

69
00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:52.830
keeps somebody like me who is prone to creative

70
00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:57.809
tangents. It keeps me on the straight and narrow

71
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.070
and not, you know, taking the reader to a

72
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.289
place they don't need to go and they don't

73
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.899
even really want to go, which is, you know,

74
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.139
kind of important. You, you have to keep your

75
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:16.070
readers uh needs in mind. You know, I think

76
00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.798
as a writer, I think that's important, not just

77
00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.380
your own needs. It's, it's, it's a conversation you're

78
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.179
having in a sense with someone who is picking

79
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.850
up your work and, and, and and you have

80
00:04:27.859 --> 00:04:29.559
to remember that it's not one sided.

81
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.700
Yeah. You know, I, I was curious about asking

82
00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:36.339
you about that. O of course, again, you're just

83
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.890
one single creator. There are many different ways of

84
00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:43.750
doing the same thing. I bet. So, but I,

85
00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:46.980
I was just thinking so for example, we've already

86
00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:49.890
talked here on the show about, for example, uh

87
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.809
a game of Thrones, I mentioned a few times

88
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.309
one piece and I mean, I was just uh

89
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.029
and the Lord of the Rings also, for example,

90
00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.440
uh I was just thinking about uh when writers

91
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.959
try to go about creating those massive stories that

92
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.160
go for more than 1000 chapters in manga or

93
00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:18.839
several different uh 1000 pages volumes uh book volumes.

94
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.940
I was just thinking, how much ahead do they

95
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.959
plan their story? Because sometimes the story flows so

96
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.089
well that one as a reader would think. Oh

97
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.529
OK. So this guy before he started his story,

98
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.910
he might have had uh II I don't know

99
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.929
1000 pages of detailed plot, plot lines or scenes

100
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.634
that he would go through and he must have

101
00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:54.174
had everything planned from the start. But then you

102
00:05:54.183 --> 00:05:58.824
get to, I don't know the latest or what

103
00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:02.704
will be the latest book by George RR Martin

104
00:06:02.713 --> 00:06:04.843
the Winds of winter. And he's been trying to

105
00:06:04.854 --> 00:06:09.264
write it since 2011 and he's just like stuck

106
00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:12.223
beca and, and then, and then when that something

107
00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:14.903
like that happens when the writer goes for 12

108
00:06:14.914 --> 00:06:18.398
years without being able to, to finish the sixth

109
00:06:18.407 --> 00:06:21.187
book in the install the sixth installment in the

110
00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:24.007
series. You're like, oh, ok. So wait a minute,

111
00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:27.247
let's track back a little bit because this guy

112
00:06:27.257 --> 00:06:31.808
hasn't planned that far ahead because now he doesn't

113
00:06:31.817 --> 00:06:35.048
know what to do with so many plot lines

114
00:06:35.058 --> 00:06:38.317
and with so many different things happening at the

115
00:06:38.328 --> 00:06:41.507
same time in the story. And then, you know,

116
00:06:41.518 --> 00:06:47.002
then sometimes readers read too much into something that

117
00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:49.731
came previously in the story and, and then they

118
00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:53.402
expect it to come back and a plot line

119
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:54.971
and, and it was never intended to be

120
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:57.421
that. Yeah. And, and, and sometimes it's just, oh

121
00:06:57.432 --> 00:07:01.111
my God, these, these here two books ago was

122
00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:04.631
foreshadowing or, and it's not foreshadowing at all. It

123
00:07:04.641 --> 00:07:10.221
was just that they coincidentally uh brought to the

124
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:15.506
story, something that if you look back, it, it

125
00:07:15.515 --> 00:07:20.036
seems that 200 chapters ago there was foreshadowing for

126
00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:23.175
that, but it was not for shadowing at

127
00:07:23.305 --> 00:07:25.376
all. I'll tell you when I look at someone

128
00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:27.716
like George RR Martin, I'm sure that Game of

129
00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:30.286
Thrones, the TV series was both a blessing and

130
00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:33.906
a curse because something like that, it, it really

131
00:07:33.915 --> 00:07:39.335
does interrupt your story process and you don't, you

132
00:07:39.346 --> 00:07:44.140
don't want it to kind of absorb into your

133
00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:48.309
vision for the story. But it does, I think

134
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:55.279
that um the same is probably true uh for,

135
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.549
for people who, um, for kind of established people

136
00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:01.640
with an established voice in their writing if they

137
00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:04.019
attempt to use a I for something more than

138
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:07.500
say an outline, um, because it's, it, it, it

139
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.579
begins to conflict with your own ideas, but it

140
00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:12.700
gives you ideas at the same time, but then

141
00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:15.450
you kind of lose sight of where you are.

142
00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:20.440
And I think that, that probably, I can't imagine

143
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.649
that didn't have an effect on him to watch

144
00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:27.890
them in my, you know, in our opinion, badly

145
00:08:27.899 --> 00:08:31.299
finish up his series, right? And now there are

146
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:35.020
all these expectations and he's probably got to do,

147
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.820
you know, the double work of, for one of,

148
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.659
I'm sure his work was interrupted by the series

149
00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.308
because he had to attend to that. But then

150
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.340
to extract himself from the conclusions that the series

151
00:08:48.349 --> 00:08:53.789
writers made and also allow there to be perhaps

152
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.809
time enough for fans of the television series to

153
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:04.190
get unvested in the way that the series writers

154
00:09:04.619 --> 00:09:07.479
um develop the characters and end of the story

155
00:09:07.489 --> 00:09:11.780
so that they can invest in what Martin is

156
00:09:11.789 --> 00:09:16.840
writing. Um That II, I mean, I can imagine

157
00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:19.299
that's a huge challenge. I mean, II, I know

158
00:09:19.309 --> 00:09:21.130
a lot of people are so mad at him

159
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.750
for not having come out with um with this

160
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.570
latest uh you know, installment of Game of Thrones,

161
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.429
but I completely understand it and I, I think

162
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.929
he's probably doing the right thing, taking his time

163
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.820
about it because unless he was just so in

164
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.469
the zone and could finish it, despite the fact

165
00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:44.270
that he had this Blockbuster series going on, which,

166
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.469
I mean, unless you're a hermit of a writer,

167
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.789
how can you not be affected by that? Um,

168
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.630
I think probably the more time he gives it

169
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.599
the more, um, hopefully, you know, readers will be

170
00:09:58.609 --> 00:10:02.739
willing to reinvest in his, uh, in his vision

171
00:10:03.789 --> 00:10:06.640
for the story. I suspect he's gonna end it

172
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.320
quite differently than the way it ended, don't you?

173
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.059
I

174
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.719
hope so. I really

175
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.960
do. I mean, I, I really don't see it

176
00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:17.559
going any other way. Um, BECAUSE I mean, the

177
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.510
way they ended, it was just so mind bogglingly

178
00:10:20.989 --> 00:10:23.559
television for God's sake, you know, I mean, it

179
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.669
was just so it was so

180
00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:29.539
amateur AAA and you know what I like is,

181
00:10:29.549 --> 00:10:34.229
uh, when sometimes writers are really honest about how

182
00:10:34.239 --> 00:10:37.840
they do things and how things work because I've

183
00:10:37.849 --> 00:10:40.909
watched a few months ago an interview with George

184
00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:46.440
Rrrr Martin and, uh, uh, the interviewers were asking

185
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.510
him. Oh, so you've, uh, did you, have you

186
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.359
seen that, um, that theory, uh, uh that was

187
00:10:54.369 --> 00:10:58.669
made by fans that's, uh, going around, uh, in

188
00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:02.260
the, on the internet about this or that, or

189
00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.619
is something that happened in the book? The, uh

190
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.023
does it have this or that meaning? And he

191
00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:10.672
was like, and he was like, look, you can

192
00:11:10.682 --> 00:11:13.723
do with my story, whatever you want, it doesn't

193
00:11:13.732 --> 00:11:17.922
bother me. But people are sometimes read too much

194
00:11:17.932 --> 00:11:21.502
into your own work. It's not that complex. The

195
00:11:21.513 --> 00:11:24.103
only thing I have in mind there was this

196
00:11:24.112 --> 00:11:29.252
simple thing. It's not like connecting 1000 different points

197
00:11:29.263 --> 00:11:31.833
in the story. It's nothing like that. It was

198
00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:36.565
as simple as this. And so, and he also

199
00:11:36.575 --> 00:11:39.755
says that there are things for example, but his

200
00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:44.846
characters, for example, the color of someone's eyes or

201
00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:49.546
particular aspects of their personality or particular things that

202
00:11:49.765 --> 00:11:52.835
he mentions in the main story, but are, are

203
00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:55.416
not part of the main story. I mean, some

204
00:11:55.426 --> 00:11:58.469
of the background story to a Game of Thrones,

205
00:11:58.479 --> 00:12:01.640
for example, that he actually has to go and

206
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:06.330
ask other experts on his own books because he

207
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.020
doesn't remember anymore.

208
00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:14.609
Ricardo. It's so true because I mean, I, you

209
00:12:14.619 --> 00:12:18.130
know, I, I write in usually in series form,

210
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.979
at least like a loose series of, of, of,

211
00:12:20.989 --> 00:12:22.780
you know, books, there might be a series of

212
00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:25.750
books that are in the same universe and my

213
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.710
kids are always kind of laughing at me because

214
00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:29.900
they'll see me like rereading my own books and

215
00:12:29.909 --> 00:12:32.419
they're like, why are you reading your own book?

216
00:12:32.429 --> 00:12:34.669
You know, like, because I don't remember what I

217
00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:37.059
wrote and I have to make sure that I

218
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.479
have continuity. So I'm sitting there reading my own

219
00:12:39.489 --> 00:12:41.960
books, you know, taking notes going, oh my God,

220
00:12:41.979 --> 00:12:44.320
I completely forgot that I wrote that you know,

221
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.469
because you, do, you forget it the way you

222
00:12:46.479 --> 00:12:49.469
forget things in your own life and, you know,

223
00:12:49.479 --> 00:12:51.210
a friend might be like, don't you remember when

224
00:12:51.219 --> 00:12:53.210
we did Xy and Z and you're like, no,

225
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.979
I don't remember that at all. When did that

226
00:12:54.989 --> 00:12:57.390
happen? You know, and, and you know, to them,

227
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.940
it was obviously kind of an, in a fairly

228
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.409
important experience, at least enough for them to remember

229
00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:06.849
what happened and you're looking at them like, II,

230
00:13:06.859 --> 00:13:08.510
I got nothing, you know what I mean?

231
00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.590
But, but, but it is,

232
00:13:10.609 --> 00:13:14.200
it's incredibly detailed work writing a series and, you

233
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.260
know, unless the series is, is very simple, you

234
00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:23.580
know, and, and, but um ok, there's just a

235
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:31.150
lot going on, you're writing somebody's life and sometimes

236
00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:35.010
the lives of multiple characters and it can, it

237
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.830
can, you can easily misremember what happened in your

238
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.969
own story the same way you can, you can,

239
00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:44.760
uh you know, have a false memory about something

240
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.289
in your own life and um interpret a whole

241
00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:52.760
series of events differently because you remember it differently

242
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.289
than other people who are experiencing it.

243
00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.440
Yeah. But, but that's the thing because we, because

244
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.840
there are people who are able to create such

245
00:14:03.849 --> 00:14:08.960
good stories. We sort of tend to idolize them

246
00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:12.099
and think of them as being people who died

247
00:14:12.109 --> 00:14:17.260
with, I don't know, 200 IQ and perfect memories

248
00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:20.890
and a big planners and they, they, and, and

249
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.739
like they are the, the, your book in their

250
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:28.059
head from the very beginning. But actually, uh, uh,

251
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.919
uh, I, I mean, I've never wrote a book

252
00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:34.979
but I would imagine that perhaps most of the

253
00:14:34.989 --> 00:14:39.270
time you're actually rereading and rewriting,

254
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.869
for sure. I'm doing something right now that I've

255
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.780
never done before. Um, I'm writing a Cold War

256
00:14:48.789 --> 00:14:51.869
Detective. No, our series, but I'm gonna finish the

257
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.260
first. Uh, WELL, I'm gonna call it a season.

258
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.320
It may never have more than one season, but

259
00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.059
I'm kind of using television language for this because

260
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.880
it, it, it seems appropriate for the way I'm

261
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.359
structuring it. I, I want to finish the entire

262
00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:08.580
first season which will be several books, not like

263
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.260
super thick books, like my breath series is thick.

264
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.409
It's, you know, it's historical fantasy. So they're like,

265
00:15:13.419 --> 00:15:19.010
you know, 450 pages, whatever. Each, these are barely

266
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.330
not, you know, they're, they're novels but they're Detective

267
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.090
Noir. And so they're more in the style, you

268
00:15:24.099 --> 00:15:25.900
know, well, obviously more in the style of, but

269
00:15:25.909 --> 00:15:27.530
also, you know, it's more of what you would

270
00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:31.450
expect from. Um, YOU know, Dashiell Hammett and other

271
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:37.960
noir writers. Um, BUT I, what I'm gonna be

272
00:15:37.969 --> 00:15:45.859
interested to find out is if I prefer writing

273
00:15:45.869 --> 00:15:48.739
the books, one at a time being able to

274
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.500
sit on them for a while, think about it,

275
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.190
then write the next book or to essentially write

276
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.780
it like, you know, one big story, one big

277
00:15:56.789 --> 00:16:04.830
book um, but all at once, basically, you know

278
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.450
what I mean? All at once, write all these

279
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.429
books at once. And, um, you know, my intention

280
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.940
is, you know, I'm, I'm doing a little experiment

281
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.979
here. My intention is to, uh release them quickly

282
00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:21.150
and sequentially because I'd like to see how that

283
00:16:21.159 --> 00:16:24.109
works. You know, I'd like to see if, um,

284
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.070
if, uh, it becomes more, you know, if, if

285
00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.609
it becomes in inspiring motivating for a reader to

286
00:16:33.619 --> 00:16:37.059
just, you know, go through the entire series at

287
00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.260
once this way with you kind of in real

288
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:43.510
time as they're being, um as they're being introduced

289
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.049
and launched. I'm, I'm rereading this, this book right

290
00:16:47.059 --> 00:16:49.229
now and I'm really just at the very beginning,

291
00:16:49.239 --> 00:16:54.659
but I'm, I'm, I'm enjoying the experience a lot.

292
00:16:54.669 --> 00:16:57.340
It's called The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron. I

293
00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:58.969
mean, it's like 30 years old. She was an

294
00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:05.750
ex-wife of Martin Scorsese and she's, she's kind of

295
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.900
made, she's a writer too, but she also made

296
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:13.160
a second career basically out of um unlocking people's

297
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:17.358
creativity. Yeah, kind of this, this sort of motivational

298
00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:24.009
style teacher. But um it, and, but somehow this

299
00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:25.588
was a book I never ended up reading, like,

300
00:17:25.598 --> 00:17:27.769
I, I love books, like Writing Down The Bones

301
00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:31.788
by um Natalie Goldberg. But um I, I'd never

302
00:17:31.798 --> 00:17:34.348
read the Artist's Way. And even though it's, it's

303
00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:38.119
probably the most, um it, it, it's the kind

304
00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:39.630
of book that I would most relate to because

305
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.400
it does kind of take this, this spiritual approach

306
00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.890
to creativity and, and, and, um that's something that's,

307
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.790
you know, very much part of my personality makeup.

308
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:57.540
But it, it kind of takes you through the

309
00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.900
process of sitting with a story and, and being

310
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.650
in a place where you can eavesdrop on the

311
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:12.119
characters, which, uh you know, a lot of it's

312
00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.180
that it's easy to get out of that place

313
00:18:14.189 --> 00:18:15.729
and to put a lot of pressure on yourself

314
00:18:15.739 --> 00:18:16.910
and be like, oh my God. Now I've got

315
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.380
to write this and I think that when you

316
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.599
stop eavesdropping on your characters, you start putting, um,

317
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.430
kind of undue, focus on maybe the setting and

318
00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:29.979
you can write, you know, three pages of expo

319
00:18:30.189 --> 00:18:32.729
exposition, just sort of describing where people are and

320
00:18:32.739 --> 00:18:34.579
you don't need three pages of that. You know,

321
00:18:34.589 --> 00:18:38.119
it's, it's usually not always. But, um, you know,

322
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.219
you can really become tiresome for a reader if

323
00:18:41.229 --> 00:18:44.550
you're not, um, in the zone, if that makes

324
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.650
sense, you know, if you're not in a, in

325
00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.250
a place where you're able to listen. Yeah. And

326
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.010
I think being in that place where you're able

327
00:18:54.020 --> 00:19:00.469
to listen makes it, um, will make, it, makes

328
00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:03.469
it a lot more likely that, uh, you're also

329
00:19:03.479 --> 00:19:05.540
listening to the needs of the reader, not just

330
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:11.410
to your own needs. Mhm. But anyway, so I,

331
00:19:11.489 --> 00:19:16.150
I'm, I've started on this and I'm trying to

332
00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.489
get up earlier in the morning. And read it

333
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.209
before I start work rather than reading at night,

334
00:19:22.219 --> 00:19:27.819
which is my usual, um, mo, uh, because I

335
00:19:27.829 --> 00:19:29.569
just get so tired at night that I really

336
00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:32.150
can't make it past a couple of pages anyway

337
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.449
and I just fall right, right asleep. Um, BUT

338
00:19:36.459 --> 00:19:38.989
it's interesting and it's, it's also, I started reading

339
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.219
it because I, um, I, I've started book coaching

340
00:19:42.229 --> 00:19:45.729
someone, a friend of mine who's wanted to write,

341
00:19:45.739 --> 00:19:48.430
uh who's a very good writer and a creative

342
00:19:48.439 --> 00:19:50.510
person, but who has never written a novel and

343
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.160
has, and wants to write a series, which the

344
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.369
idea for her series is just terrific. So I'm

345
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.800
really excited about it. It's been a lot of

346
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:03.020
fun coaching her and, you know, I've kind of

347
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.219
book, coached people in piecemeal throughout the years, but

348
00:20:06.229 --> 00:20:08.420
it's something that I've never really wanted to commit

349
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.420
to, um for one because I have three kids

350
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.459
at home and you really, you can only do

351
00:20:14.469 --> 00:20:18.969
so much. But it's, it's, you know, it, it

352
00:20:18.979 --> 00:20:20.800
sort of came at the right time because I'm

353
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.329
trying to write this series, you know, which is

354
00:20:23.339 --> 00:20:25.770
very different from, it's very different from the way

355
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.619
I usually write. And so I'm, it, it's also

356
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.069
forcing me to take my own advice and to

357
00:20:32.079 --> 00:20:39.400
follow that. Um So that's that, I don't know

358
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.010
where else to go with that. But, um, oh,

359
00:20:42.829 --> 00:20:46.060
ok. So le let me put, let me put

360
00:20:46.069 --> 00:20:49.650
a pin on that book coaching thing because I

361
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.729
want to get back to that. I don't know

362
00:20:51.739 --> 00:20:55.250
if to, if today or next time. Let's see,

363
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.250
because I, because I have a particular uh interesting,

364
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.959
let's say thought experiment to ask you about that

365
00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:06.910
thought experiments. We always talk about thought experiments when

366
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.189
we get together. It's great.

367
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.901
Yeah. But, but le let me ask you this,

368
00:21:10.911 --> 00:21:14.151
uh are there times where you get a little

369
00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:17.192
bit frustrated about what you think are perhaps some

370
00:21:17.202 --> 00:21:23.092
of the limitations of your medium? There is limitations

371
00:21:23.102 --> 00:21:26.871
of being a writer instead of being, for example,

372
00:21:27.141 --> 00:21:32.381
uh Mange or someone who creates uh comics or

373
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:36.313
uh a film director. Just because for example, in

374
00:21:36.323 --> 00:21:40.504
those particular cases, they have visual aid to the

375
00:21:40.514 --> 00:21:43.093
story, right? I mean, are, are there times where

376
00:21:43.104 --> 00:21:45.313
you, where you think? Oh my God, if I

377
00:21:45.323 --> 00:21:48.114
was doing a movie instead of a book or

378
00:21:48.124 --> 00:21:50.923
if I was doing a comic instead of a

379
00:21:50.933 --> 00:21:55.673
book, this would be so much easier to portray

380
00:21:55.683 --> 00:21:57.894
or I, I mean, I'm not trying to ask

381
00:21:57.904 --> 00:22:00.163
you here, of course, but I'm not, I'm not

382
00:22:00.173 --> 00:22:04.475
trying to imply that that uh a book is

383
00:22:04.485 --> 00:22:09.215
better or worse than cinema or comics or whatever.

384
00:22:09.225 --> 00:22:13.115
It's just that perhaps you think that there are

385
00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:17.865
particular things, particular aspects that you think that perhaps

386
00:22:17.875 --> 00:22:23.916
are better than or portrayed in mediums where you

387
00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:27.286
have a visual aspect to them. For example,

388
00:22:27.306 --> 00:22:31.079
I, I think that is, yes, I mean, the,

389
00:22:31.089 --> 00:22:33.339
the short answer is yes, I, you know, I,

390
00:22:33.349 --> 00:22:38.089
you can almost see that at play in any

391
00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:42.130
medium. You can see where uh on occasion, at

392
00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:47.869
least where um the creator had to invent a

393
00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.209
device. Maybe it's a narrator, you know, who, who

394
00:22:52.219 --> 00:22:55.089
in a film, you know, who kind of talks

395
00:22:55.099 --> 00:22:59.849
over what's going on. Um Because they, they simply

396
00:22:59.859 --> 00:23:03.859
weren't able to adequately tell the story without that.

397
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.479
And for sure, there are times because I'm a

398
00:23:06.489 --> 00:23:09.780
really visual person. I love film, you know, II,

399
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.319
I enjoy film as much as I enjoy reading

400
00:23:13.329 --> 00:23:18.540
a really juicy novel. Um So there are many

401
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.489
times when I'm writing something and I really have

402
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:27.219
to stop and think because I'm trying to um

403
00:23:28.349 --> 00:23:33.359
explain something that's very visual and yet I don't

404
00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:36.430
want to do it in a way that bores

405
00:23:36.439 --> 00:23:40.910
or exhaust the reader. And I'm, you know, I'm

406
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.810
sure that that's the case and for someone, you

407
00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:49.060
know, creating manga or, um you know, comic books,

408
00:23:49.069 --> 00:23:52.579
comic books, you know, it's not like in most

409
00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:55.619
cases, you can have someone do a monologue that's

410
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.790
this long, you know, I mean, you have to

411
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.260
have a very crisp, it's kind of like tweeting,

412
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.209
you know.

413
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:06.260
Well, well, actually, actually it's nice but, but actually

414
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.709
it's also interesting because there are many different kinds

415
00:24:09.719 --> 00:24:13.979
of styles for comic books and manga because there

416
00:24:13.989 --> 00:24:18.849
are um some creators that let's put it this

417
00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:23.050
way, they are very verbose. So sometimes you get

418
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.349
almost walls of text and you are like, oh

419
00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:30.619
come on, it's, you know, to

420
00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:32.420
me, then you lose the visual and the whole

421
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.280
point is the visual. It's the play between the

422
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.439
words in the bubble, right? But

423
00:24:37.449 --> 00:24:41.760
some of those creators are actually very good and

424
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:46.619
sometimes that sort of wall of text is needed

425
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:51.670
or warranted. But, but, but there are others and

426
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.339
again, I'm not saying that one way is better

427
00:24:55.349 --> 00:24:58.670
than the other. It's uh whatever you prefer. But

428
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.910
there are others that they almost do not have

429
00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.170
any text at all. It's the, they are so

430
00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:12.430
good with uh telling you a story just through

431
00:25:12.589 --> 00:25:16.959
images that they uh they just need one word

432
00:25:16.969 --> 00:25:20.099
here or there. Sometimes they even o on a

433
00:25:20.109 --> 00:25:23.150
single page, they occupy it with an image and

434
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.390
then one single vertical wor word or something like

435
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.989
that and it's enough. So, you know, it, it

436
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.739
is, it's, it's amazing how uh the many different

437
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:41.079
ways there are for people to create great stories,

438
00:25:41.089 --> 00:25:41.630
I guess

439
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.910
there, there are and they're infinite, aren't they? And,

440
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:52.569
and it just sort of depends on um on,

441
00:25:52.579 --> 00:25:54.920
on the way on the creators approach and what

442
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:58.989
their, what their own skills are. No, you know,

443
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.869
some are, it's amazing when you read some books

444
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.109
that are so dialogue heavy and yet they don't

445
00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:07.900
feel that way because, you know, reading just a

446
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:12.199
bunch of dialogue can without any descriptors, you know,

447
00:26:12.209 --> 00:26:15.189
without anything in between that tells you where they

448
00:26:15.199 --> 00:26:17.959
are or, you know, how a character, a little

449
00:26:17.969 --> 00:26:20.719
movement that a character might have made that, that

450
00:26:20.729 --> 00:26:24.319
lets you know what exactly they're trying to say.

451
00:26:24.329 --> 00:26:26.800
E even though, you know, they might be talking

452
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.239
about the weather but really they're talking about something

453
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.689
else underneath and, and, you know, that just because

454
00:26:31.699 --> 00:26:34.760
of, you know, a look, they give someone, you,

455
00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:35.810
you know what?

456
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:39.260
It's incredible to be able to do that without

457
00:26:40.109 --> 00:26:43.410
that, you know, without those, that those descriptors, you

458
00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.130
know, and just to do it through dialogue. And

459
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.560
then on the other hand, you have other people

460
00:26:46.569 --> 00:26:50.030
who will have almost no dialogue at all, which

461
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.609
can also be dreary and yet are able to

462
00:26:53.619 --> 00:26:57.930
communicate a scene, a party, a cocktail party where

463
00:26:57.939 --> 00:27:01.000
everybody is talking, you know, without hardly a single

464
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.050
word of dialogue and yet it's incredible, you

465
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.300
know, OK, so I'm going to give you two

466
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.560
different examples. So, uh first of all, I'm uh

467
00:27:09.199 --> 00:27:14.989
a sucker for a good dialogue story. I love,

468
00:27:15.099 --> 00:27:19.489
I love dialogue. I mean, even in movies, one

469
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.880
of the things, one of the criteria that I

470
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.530
use to classify a movie as good is it

471
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.589
has good dialogue. OK. So for me, it's almost

472
00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:29.849
all of what

473
00:27:30.109 --> 00:27:33.572
makes, makes me wanna throw rotten tomatoes.

474
00:27:33.603 --> 00:27:37.863
But, but there's, there's a movie, I don't know

475
00:27:37.873 --> 00:27:40.802
if you ever watch it, watched it. Uh My

476
00:27:40.812 --> 00:27:42.292
dinner with Andre.

477
00:27:42.723 --> 00:27:44.373
Oh, yes. Oh my

478
00:27:44.512 --> 00:27:49.233
God. Look, there's the visual aid there for sure,

479
00:27:49.243 --> 00:27:52.493
because it's a movie. But still, it's one of

480
00:27:52.503 --> 00:27:56.755
my favorite movies and it's just, it's as simple

481
00:27:56.765 --> 00:28:00.416
as you can get. It's like two guys, two

482
00:28:00.635 --> 00:28:00.816
guys

483
00:28:00.865 --> 00:28:01.566
having dinner and,

484
00:28:02.926 --> 00:28:09.855
and, and having A&E long conversation about anything and

485
00:28:09.865 --> 00:28:13.306
everything. And I really love that movie and, and

486
00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:16.839
then on the others on the other side, uh

487
00:28:16.849 --> 00:28:21.280
there's a Portuguese writer from the 19th century called

488
00:28:21.489 --> 00:28:26.900
S Kos. And uh he's magnum opus or at

489
00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:29.930
least the book that people consider his magnum opus.

490
00:28:29.939 --> 00:28:34.729
It's even mandatory reading here in Portuguese schools is

491
00:28:34.739 --> 00:28:39.689
uh the Mayas in English and Portuguese Mayas. But

492
00:28:39.699 --> 00:28:44.750
anyway, and he, he is, he was a realist

493
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.550
writer. I mean, realism from the 19th century where

494
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.829
many times some of those writers were really heavy

495
00:28:53.839 --> 00:28:57.310
when it comes to description, I mean, sin, description

496
00:28:57.319 --> 00:29:01.359
and describing places and all of that. And I

497
00:29:01.369 --> 00:29:03.880
mean, I love the story, but I have to

498
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:08.520
be honest whenever it gets to the descriptions, I

499
00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.920
have to skip them because it's just too much.

500
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:16.319
I mean, he describes every single object in the

501
00:29:16.329 --> 00:29:19.000
room and I'm like, oh, come on, man.

502
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.239
Well, yeah, you have to. II I feel at

503
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.579
least, yeah, I mean, I guess you don't have

504
00:29:24.589 --> 00:29:27.369
to but um I, I feel like you want

505
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.920
to leave something to the imagination of the reader

506
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.800
for them to fill in you know, you want

507
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.670
to sketch it for sure. And you want to

508
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.560
give them a little color here and there. But

509
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.099
that makes it the reader's own too. That's how,

510
00:29:42.109 --> 00:29:45.670
you know, readers feel a sense of um investment

511
00:29:45.709 --> 00:29:49.569
in a look about to use their imaginations

512
00:29:49.579 --> 00:29:52.800
too and about the descriptions. I don't know if

513
00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.099
you agree with me on this or not, but

514
00:29:55.469 --> 00:29:58.199
the descriptions I like the most are the ones

515
00:29:58.209 --> 00:30:04.170
where you are describing relevant things to the story.

516
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.430
So I don't know, let's think about the concept

517
00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:11.780
of uh Chekhov's gun. OK. So you're describing the

518
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:15.969
gun but the gun, the gun gets used but

519
00:30:15.979 --> 00:30:20.569
you, but just describing all the chairs, the tables

520
00:30:20.682 --> 00:30:23.302
are, these are that way and then it doesn't

521
00:30:23.312 --> 00:30:26.422
matter at all to the plot because you're not

522
00:30:26.432 --> 00:30:28.822
going to use the chair or the table or

523
00:30:28.833 --> 00:30:32.812
the call or whatever, or the chandelier or whatever.

524
00:30:33.003 --> 00:30:36.262
I, I mean, it's just too much for me

525
00:30:36.272 --> 00:30:39.723
if you're describing things that do not. I, I

526
00:30:39.733 --> 00:30:45.493
mean, I understand that descriptions might also not be

527
00:30:45.503 --> 00:30:49.515
used useful for the plot itself. It's, it's just

528
00:30:49.526 --> 00:30:54.836
describing a beautiful scenery or a beautiful house or

529
00:30:54.845 --> 00:30:57.765
I, I understand that people might like that, but

530
00:30:57.916 --> 00:31:00.786
for me, it's just uh I, I don't know,

531
00:31:00.796 --> 00:31:04.715
it breaks the pace of the story, you know,

532
00:31:04.725 --> 00:31:04.956
I

533
00:31:04.965 --> 00:31:08.076
don't like excessive description and I, I think I've,

534
00:31:08.255 --> 00:31:10.326
I think I've committed that sin as a writer

535
00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:17.469
by the way. And um often I'll just speak

536
00:31:17.479 --> 00:31:23.849
for myself. It, it, that, that needs to be

537
00:31:23.859 --> 00:31:27.109
taken out, I think during the editorial process because

538
00:31:28.979 --> 00:31:31.219
I think sometimes when you're writing a story and

539
00:31:31.229 --> 00:31:38.410
you're listening and on that story, um you know,

540
00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.130
you're, you're building the environment in your own mind.

541
00:31:42.189 --> 00:31:44.250
If you haven't, if you're not the kind of

542
00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.930
person who builds it excessively on the front end,

543
00:31:46.939 --> 00:31:48.890
which I don't do. I, I feel like I

544
00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.410
find that inhibiting and, and then you're always at

545
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.180
least I am not you. But then I'm always

546
00:31:54.189 --> 00:31:55.920
checking to see what was it that I said

547
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:57.780
needs to be in that. Oh, well, I guess

548
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.790
I should write that in and that interrupts my

549
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.949
flow. Um But for sure. And then, then what

550
00:32:04.959 --> 00:32:07.829
you're faced with sometimes most of the time is

551
00:32:07.839 --> 00:32:10.400
that at least in some parts of your story

552
00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.160
you've over described because you, you know, you get

553
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.520
into a room and you're like, well, where, what

554
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:16.449
is this room? And then you, you know, you,

555
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.170
you describe it and sometimes you might even describe

556
00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.959
it really, really well and you've got to make

557
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.160
the decision then and not be vain about it

558
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:27.810
for heaven's sake and say, OK, that's a great

559
00:32:27.819 --> 00:32:29.819
paragraph. But it's got to go or it's got

560
00:32:29.829 --> 00:32:32.239
to be cut by two thirds because who cares?

561
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.930
You know what I mean? It's inhibiting and it's,

562
00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:39.050
it's clunky. It's, you know, you, you, you, you

563
00:32:40.189 --> 00:32:42.160
not enhancing the experience of the

564
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.939
reader and look again again, people who like that

565
00:32:45.949 --> 00:32:50.930
kind of thing perfectly, perfectly fine. I, I, I'm

566
00:32:50.939 --> 00:32:54.510
not bothered by that at all, but hi myself,

567
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.589
I'm, I'm a character and plot guy characters and

568
00:32:59.599 --> 00:33:03.969
plots are the, the, the two most important things

569
00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.630
for me. I mean, you can even be uh,

570
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:13.030
extremely bad at describing places and it doesn't matter

571
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.300
much to me as long as the, the characters

572
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:21.630
are well developed and the plot is interesting.

573
00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:26.280
II, I agree. I love character driven stories. They're

574
00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.430
my favorite. I like a good plot. You know,

575
00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:30.079
I've been, I, I want there to be a

576
00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:33.010
plot, um, with the characters but those are the

577
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.920
two most important things to me. And I think

578
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.319
that, you know, like some readers, you know, the

579
00:33:37.329 --> 00:33:42.930
sort of, um, you know, the, the Dan Brown

580
00:33:42.939 --> 00:33:47.880
stories, for instance, those, those are great. They plot

581
00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:51.520
their plot, plot, plot, plot, plot. Um, IT'S, they're

582
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.530
for people who love puzzles. Yeah. And a lot

583
00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.109
of mysteries are that way, you know? Exactly. Not

584
00:33:58.119 --> 00:33:59.729
exactly how they're going to end. You may not

585
00:33:59.739 --> 00:34:01.699
know exactly who did it but you, you know

586
00:34:01.709 --> 00:34:06.260
the procedure through the story and it's, it's, it

587
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.469
really is like playing a game, um, a board

588
00:34:09.478 --> 00:34:12.469
game or doing, uh, doing some kind of, um,

589
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.070
word puzzle, a crossword puzzle or whatnot. And I,

590
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.659
I like a little more than that. It's kind

591
00:34:18.668 --> 00:34:21.790
of, you know, why I like, uh, mystery writers.

592
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.370
Like, um, well, I feel like PD James does

593
00:34:25.379 --> 00:34:31.179
a really great job that she, she creates a

594
00:34:31.188 --> 00:34:33.899
world and it's not just a puzzle.

595
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:37.790
Oh, no. Look, II, I definitely think that, I

596
00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.540
think that the crime stories are some of the

597
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:45.300
best ones out there to explore human psychology. For

598
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.409
sure, for sure. And that's why I love to

599
00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:49.918
read. I like to explore human psychology. I like

600
00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.310
to be the person sitting there, you know, watching

601
00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.418
people go by. I like watching my own behavior.

602
00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.560
Um And as you know, and I like to

603
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.729
be as detached about it as possible and, you

604
00:35:03.739 --> 00:35:06.010
know, understand my own motives in a, in a

605
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.060
kind of clear eyed way. And I like to

606
00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:14.419
do that with others. It's um I, I just

607
00:35:14.429 --> 00:35:18.610
find that to be really, really interesting and, but,

608
00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:23.320
but the, the then Brown books look, I, I

609
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:28.010
know that perhaps I will be crucified by some

610
00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:33.899
intellectual people. But I actually like Dan Brown. I

611
00:35:33.969 --> 00:35:36.189
do. No, no, no, I, I was, I, that

612
00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:38.409
wasn't a criticism of Dan. No, no, no. I

613
00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.370
think I'm saying it's a certain style of writing

614
00:35:42.379 --> 00:35:48.750
that is, that's plot focused and hugely addictive because

615
00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:52.899
it's a puzzle and it's primarily a puzzle. It's

616
00:35:52.909 --> 00:35:56.669
not that um his characters aren't, aren't interesting, but

617
00:35:56.679 --> 00:36:00.360
that's not the focus of the book. Um What

618
00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:03.580
is it, the character in it is in Robert

619
00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.610
Langdon? I think the professor really interesting concept for

620
00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:09.820
a character, but the character doesn't get developed in

621
00:36:09.929 --> 00:36:12.919
any massive, you know, or, or deep way. It's

622
00:36:12.929 --> 00:36:17.090
about the puzzle. And, um you know,

623
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.719
uh but, but by the, by the way, since,

624
00:36:19.729 --> 00:36:23.949
since you touch there on character development, I also

625
00:36:23.959 --> 00:36:28.689
wanted to ask you this. So because people, uh

626
00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:32.239
I, I mean, at least the more critical kind

627
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:36.570
of people, they tend to uh talk a lot

628
00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:43.330
about uh developing and liking a multi-layered characters that

629
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.969
is characters that are not just one dimensional and

630
00:36:46.979 --> 00:36:51.129
that are psychologically complex. And I mean, uh but

631
00:36:51.139 --> 00:36:56.790
what does that mean? Exactly? Because uh sometimes, so

632
00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.110
ju just to, I, I mean, run through a

633
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.530
sort of abstract example, but sometimes people complain about

634
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:10.419
characters being one dimensional. But then uh on the

635
00:37:10.429 --> 00:37:15.729
other hand, sometimes people also complain about characters breaking

636
00:37:15.739 --> 00:37:19.540
character and, and sometimes it seems a bit weird

637
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.560
to me because not always, but some of those

638
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:28.229
times what people are referring to is, oh, so

639
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:32.669
this character did something in this particular situation or

640
00:37:32.899 --> 00:37:38.090
uh behaved toward another character in a way that

641
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:43.360
doesn't uh doesn't go along with the kind of

642
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:47.219
expectations you have for him. But I, isn't it

643
00:37:47.229 --> 00:37:53.379
a bit weird because we ourselves in our, let's

644
00:37:53.389 --> 00:37:58.300
say real lives, we don't behave the same way

645
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:04.239
with everyone, right? I mean, I mean, I, I

646
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.629
mean, we, we have, we behave differently depending on

647
00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:11.659
the person we, we are interacting with and the

648
00:38:11.669 --> 00:38:16.530
kind of relationship we have with them. Right. So,

649
00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.110
so what I'm trying to say is, oh, I

650
00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.780
don't know. Let's say that someone, um, I know,

651
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:28.560
let's say that you're talking about Tony Soprano and

652
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.800
he is a criminal and he's a very tough

653
00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:37.280
guy or, I mean, apparently tough guy. Uh, AND,

654
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.840
uh, uh, and then, uh, suddenly he's a guy

655
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:47.419
who can't really hurt Children and animals and all

656
00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:50.429
of that. I, I mean, people, perhaps, sometimes people

657
00:38:50.439 --> 00:38:54.939
are expecting for a criminal to be a psychopath

658
00:38:54.949 --> 00:39:00.070
and to be bad to everyone around him. But

659
00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:03.590
that doesn't need to be the case necessarily. No,

660
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:09.149
they can be, um, they can act in, you

661
00:39:09.159 --> 00:39:11.550
know, what can be viewed as a psychopathic matter

662
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:17.360
under very certain circumstances. I think, um, terrorists are

663
00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:22.010
a great example who might themselves have, you know,

664
00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.370
completely normal family lives if you went home and

665
00:39:25.379 --> 00:39:28.489
have a wife and Children, whatever it is. Um,

666
00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.919
AND then under a very particular circumstance they're capable

667
00:39:34.929 --> 00:39:37.489
of doing horrendous. Thanks.

668
00:39:38.219 --> 00:39:41.949
Yeah. Um, BUT, but

669
00:39:43.429 --> 00:39:45.840
like with war, you know, that's something that happens

670
00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.120
a lot more common under, under really intense circumstances

671
00:39:49.129 --> 00:39:51.500
like that. It's something that, you know, a soldier

672
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.669
has to contend with. It's something that someone who

673
00:39:53.679 --> 00:39:57.479
is, you know, in an occupied land or is,

674
00:39:57.699 --> 00:40:00.199
you know, an aggressor has to contend with all

675
00:40:00.209 --> 00:40:01.870
of this, even if they think that they have

676
00:40:01.879 --> 00:40:03.600
every right to be doing what they're doing.

677
00:40:04.489 --> 00:40:07.050
But, but, you know, now that I've described that

678
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.570
to you, that sort of, uh, I don't know,

679
00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:13.850
contradictory or conflicting view that people have of characters

680
00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.419
where they expect them to be one thing, but

681
00:40:16.429 --> 00:40:18.330
at the same time, they want them to be

682
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:23.659
multi layered. And so, I mean, and now now

683
00:40:23.669 --> 00:40:25.750
that I have described that to you, it came

684
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.659
to my mind that perhaps the way people react

685
00:40:28.669 --> 00:40:32.020
or think react to or think about characters is

686
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.600
the same way we think about real people because

687
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:40.260
we expect people to be, let's say a good

688
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:45.120
person or a bad person every time toward everyone

689
00:40:45.129 --> 00:40:49.500
in every situation. But sometimes people are just different

690
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:54.860
people in different situations, they behave differently to different

691
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:59.659
kinds of people and sometimes people are behaving unexpected

692
00:40:59.669 --> 00:41:00.620
ways as well.

693
00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:07.010
It's true, human beings are predictable only for kind

694
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:10.100
of it for short spurts. You know, you might

695
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.969
be able to predict if you, you know what

696
00:41:11.979 --> 00:41:14.340
I'm saying, you might be able to predict um

697
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.270
the way a conversation will go in the first

698
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:23.110
few minutes because you're exchanging pleasantries. Not always, but,

699
00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.510
you know, sometimes the conversation starts off and it's,

700
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.370
you know, it starts off in a completely different

701
00:41:27.379 --> 00:41:29.469
place than you never expected. But, you know, you

702
00:41:29.479 --> 00:41:31.979
can pretty much predict when you run into someone

703
00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:33.250
on the street that you haven't seen in a

704
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.659
while that, oh, nice to see you Ricardo. How

705
00:41:36.669 --> 00:41:38.719
are you? I'm doing well. Can you believe this

706
00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:40.899
weather? No, I can't. Sure it is hot for

707
00:41:40.909 --> 00:41:42.750
this time of year. You know, you can predict

708
00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.790
it until a certain point and then you have

709
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.100
no idea. If you actually sit down with this

710
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.090
person and you don't, you know, go your separate

711
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.139
ways, you have no idea really where that conversation

712
00:41:53.149 --> 00:41:58.620
is going to go. Um, BUT II, I, I

713
00:41:58.629 --> 00:42:02.620
think when two things happen, when someone says, oh,

714
00:42:02.629 --> 00:42:05.949
I, I didn't like that because that character wouldn't

715
00:42:05.959 --> 00:42:13.830
do that. Um Either it's because the writer failed.

716
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.879
They did not, um, at least at that point

717
00:42:19.889 --> 00:42:24.620
have the skill to help take you on that

718
00:42:24.629 --> 00:42:28.919
character's journey and show you how the character, um,

719
00:42:28.929 --> 00:42:31.510
you know, kind of build the latter rungs between

720
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.620
this behavior over here and then this seemingly out

721
00:42:36.629 --> 00:42:41.590
of character behavior over here. Um It could be

722
00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.040
because of the, uh, reader's expectation that, hey, I

723
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:47.260
wanted a happy ending. I thought those two were

724
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.840
gonna end up together, you know what I mean

725
00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:53.600
or whatever, you know, and, and their expectation kind

726
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:58.209
of superseded, maybe what was organic to the story

727
00:42:58.219 --> 00:43:01.280
in their own mind, at least. And, um, so

728
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:04.310
they, they could not accept the story that the

729
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.729
writer actually wrote because they wanted. This is what

730
00:43:07.739 --> 00:43:09.590
I wanted. I mean, you, I, I think you

731
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.080
and I have talked about um, certain genres like

732
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.139
the romance genre, for instance, that um, a book

733
00:43:16.149 --> 00:43:17.919
is not a romance and unless it has a

734
00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:22.419
happy ending then it's not a romance that it's

735
00:43:22.429 --> 00:43:26.159
a love story. If it has a, you know,

736
00:43:27.169 --> 00:43:29.459
a different ending other than, and they lived happily

737
00:43:29.469 --> 00:43:31.729
ever after or they lived happily ever after for

738
00:43:31.739 --> 00:43:36.429
now, you know what I mean? Um, AND so,

739
00:43:36.439 --> 00:43:39.590
uh, you know, you, a writer has to be

740
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.840
very careful depending on the genre that they're writing

741
00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:44.100
in. Because if you are writing a, a AAA

742
00:43:44.129 --> 00:43:50.030
piece that is pretty strictly adhering to genre, you're

743
00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.570
setting up very specific expectations for the reader. And

744
00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:58.879
if you deny the reader what they're expecting, um

745
00:43:58.889 --> 00:44:01.260
you'll be punished for it. Now, if the reader

746
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:04.399
is expecting something that's genre bending from the get

747
00:44:04.409 --> 00:44:08.340
go, they'll usually go on that journey with you

748
00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.699
if they like your writing, you know, assuming that

749
00:44:10.709 --> 00:44:13.139
they actually like what you have to say and

750
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:16.919
um and they'll enjoy being taken on that journey

751
00:44:16.929 --> 00:44:19.010
and they'll say, oh my gosh, can you believe

752
00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:24.000
that this happened? Um And, but it, it, it,

753
00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:27.360
it does a lot of, it depends on expectation.

754
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:36.840
And I, I think also, I think a, a

755
00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:41.120
writer or creator has to be careful not to

756
00:44:41.179 --> 00:44:47.000
um not to make a character, do something or

757
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:50.530
create a situation just for the sake of creating

758
00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.239
it because they want to do something different or

759
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:54.469
because they want to make a, a political point,

760
00:44:54.479 --> 00:44:58.169
you know, it's, or or, or a personal point,

761
00:44:58.179 --> 00:45:00.929
you know, it, it, that's kind of where the

762
00:45:00.939 --> 00:45:05.429
artistry comes from is understanding what is outside of

763
00:45:05.439 --> 00:45:07.669
what you're creating, what is organic to the story

764
00:45:07.679 --> 00:45:11.239
that you've set up and you've perhaps, you know,

765
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.550
written the bones off. But the, the fact is

766
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:25.239
there's something else going on besides, um, besides your,

767
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:28.389
you know, your expectations, your original expectations for the

768
00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:29.949
story. I mean, I can't tell you how many

769
00:45:29.959 --> 00:45:32.719
times I started to write something and then, and

770
00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:34.870
I've even had it, you know, plotted out and

771
00:45:34.879 --> 00:45:39.290
everything. And then I realize at some point in

772
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.409
the story that something has to change because I

773
00:45:42.419 --> 00:45:45.260
start to recognize and this can be really painful

774
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:47.270
by the way because it can undo a lot

775
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.100
of work you've already done or it can just

776
00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:53.780
hurt because you, you're realizing that something really painful

777
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.550
has to happen in this story and, and writing

778
00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.070
that is painful. You know, if you have to

779
00:46:00.649 --> 00:46:03.090
kill a character for instance, that you've become really

780
00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.209
attached to and you're realizing, oh my God, this

781
00:46:05.219 --> 00:46:08.250
person can't survive this. I didn't realize that when

782
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.830
I was writing it. You know, I thought this

783
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.219
person was gonna survive. I thought this person was

784
00:46:12.229 --> 00:46:15.800
gonna go on and, and do you know the

785
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.360
things that I had prescribed for them? But I'm

786
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:21.209
realizing right now that they're about to get it

787
00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:21.780
in the neck.

788
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:28.139
Yeah. No. No. About the ex the expectations So

789
00:46:28.429 --> 00:46:31.770
several ideas. So one of them is you really

790
00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:38.760
get to have direct contact with how different expectations

791
00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:43.370
make people love or hate stories. When there's an

792
00:46:43.379 --> 00:46:47.340
ongoing story. And you go, for example, to online

793
00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:51.679
forums and people are trying to uh trying to

794
00:46:51.689 --> 00:46:54.979
imagine what we like happen next in the story.

795
00:46:54.989 --> 00:46:58.239
And then there are people that say, oh the

796
00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.830
X should happen. And then there are people that

797
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.370
say, why should happen. And there are people that

798
00:47:03.379 --> 00:47:07.850
say, oh wherever, wherever uh let's see what happens

799
00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.989
and then we'll see if it's good or not.

800
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.780
And when the uh for example, people who got

801
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:18.419
it right? Usually like the story, people who got

802
00:47:18.429 --> 00:47:23.790
it wrong usually. Yeah. And then the ones that

803
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.209
were just open to see where things would go.

804
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:29.870
I mean, most of the time, if they already

805
00:47:29.879 --> 00:47:33.520
like the story, they keep liking it sometimes it's

806
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:36.370
just, oh, this was a bit silly. Uh And

807
00:47:36.379 --> 00:47:39.689
then also you mentioned uh politics at a certain

808
00:47:39.699 --> 00:47:43.310
point there. And I was thinking like, ee even

809
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:48.810
politics, sometimes, even if a book is heavily political,

810
00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:54.669
sometimes it works. So it just, just think about

811
00:47:54.679 --> 00:47:58.979
Ayn Rand's Atlas Rugged. I, I mean, for me,

812
00:47:58.989 --> 00:48:04.340
that book is awful, but Libertarians, they love the

813
00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.310
book. It's like, it's like the best book

814
00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:13.719
ever. Conde's books are I think, beautiful and they're,

815
00:48:13.939 --> 00:48:17.870
I think he was absolutely robbed of the Nobel

816
00:48:17.879 --> 00:48:23.489
in literature, but they're highly political. You know, um,

817
00:48:25.399 --> 00:48:27.179
I don't think it's ever, I, I think that

818
00:48:27.189 --> 00:48:31.709
the, the story is at the forefront and the

819
00:48:31.719 --> 00:48:34.979
story is so compelling which is what makes it,

820
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:40.060
um, which is what makes it so good. You

821
00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:43.379
know, even though he has a very clear political

822
00:48:43.389 --> 00:48:45.219
point of view, I mean, it's kind of impossible

823
00:48:45.229 --> 00:48:47.939
to miss but, and, and it's interesting because what

824
00:48:47.949 --> 00:48:50.929
I, I read it's just the opposite. Her politics

825
00:48:50.939 --> 00:48:54.770
are fascinating. You know what I mean? And, you

826
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.219
know, her characters aren't that great. The story is

827
00:48:57.229 --> 00:49:00.360
interesting. I think the plots are pretty interesting but

828
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:03.439
the characters aren't that great but her, but she

829
00:49:03.449 --> 00:49:06.540
is, she is such a force. She is so

830
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:12.040
interesting that, like, like you said, particularly libertarians, particularly

831
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:18.919
if you are, um, you know, highly susceptible to

832
00:49:18.929 --> 00:49:21.679
that point of view. It's riveting for you the

833
00:49:21.689 --> 00:49:24.780
way, you know, happily ever after is the only

834
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:27.209
acceptable outcome for someone who is a true lover

835
00:49:27.219 --> 00:49:28.030
of romance.

836
00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:32.040
Yeah. And, and the same for the same for

837
00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:33.939
people on the left. I don't know if, you

838
00:49:33.949 --> 00:49:38.600
know Berthold Brecht or a writer from the, I

839
00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:41.530
think the late 19th century. And, I mean, his

840
00:49:41.629 --> 00:49:41.739
book

841
00:49:42.229 --> 00:49:42.919
I haven't read.

842
00:49:43.129 --> 00:49:47.949
Yeah, he, his books, his books are like a

843
00:49:47.969 --> 00:49:53.840
cheesecake for leftists. It's, it's just, it's just like

844
00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:58.669
bashing the powerful uplifting the Van Dren. Yeah. But,

845
00:49:58.679 --> 00:50:04.889
and I mean, the books are ob, uh, objectively

846
00:50:04.899 --> 00:50:08.590
speaking, not that great, but for someone who is

847
00:50:09.489 --> 00:50:11.989
just for someone who, who, you know, wants to

848
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.780
experience that. Right. Yeah.

849
00:50:15.419 --> 00:50:18.290
And then uh just going back to the character

850
00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:22.250
for a second. Uh Also there are particular kinds

851
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:28.959
of uh stories or fiction where a sort of

852
00:50:28.969 --> 00:50:34.270
one dimensional characters work pretty well and work best.

853
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:39.439
So for example, Mr Bean, the, the comedy series,

854
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:44.489
I mean, I mean, Mr Bin is the simplest

855
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.739
character, you can create the, the thing there is

856
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:54.199
about creating funny situations. It's not really about the

857
00:50:54.209 --> 00:50:59.439
character being extremely complex. It's a very simple character,

858
00:50:59.449 --> 00:51:03.840
but it's a great comedy series, right?

859
00:51:04.989 --> 00:51:07.439
No, it's true. And that's, that's kind of WW

860
00:51:07.449 --> 00:51:11.469
well, you know, that goes back to, to whatever

861
00:51:11.479 --> 00:51:14.189
the particular strengths of the writer are because there

862
00:51:14.199 --> 00:51:19.669
are people who are incredibly good at creating circumstances

863
00:51:19.689 --> 00:51:23.379
that force the characters to react to the circumstances

864
00:51:23.389 --> 00:51:25.649
and then others do the inverse where the creator

865
00:51:25.659 --> 00:51:29.689
or the creators, where the characters influence the circumstances

866
00:51:29.699 --> 00:51:33.330
and all you wanna do is is follow that

867
00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:38.800
character around and you know, watch them influence their

868
00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:41.909
environment to watch other people react to them, other

869
00:51:41.919 --> 00:51:45.709
characters react to them, watch how an organization might

870
00:51:45.719 --> 00:51:49.739
change by the addition of this person, you know,

871
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:53.219
or um God, what is it that there's a

872
00:51:53.229 --> 00:51:58.479
great um what is it called? Oh God, I'm

873
00:51:58.489 --> 00:51:59.629
not going to bore you with it then because

874
00:51:59.639 --> 00:52:01.120
if I can't recall it, I'm not gonna sit

875
00:52:01.129 --> 00:52:04.389
here going now. What was that. But the story

876
00:52:04.399 --> 00:52:09.750
was basically about um a bureaucrat who likes things

877
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.270
to be the absolute same all the time. It's

878
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:16.669
an old Thurber story, James Thurber I believe, and

879
00:52:17.379 --> 00:52:22.340
a woman is hired into this company to make

880
00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:27.340
changes as his boss. And that is very bad

881
00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:29.919
for this guy. He does not like change. And

882
00:52:29.929 --> 00:52:33.419
so he goes about orchestrating her demise, you know,

883
00:52:33.719 --> 00:52:35.629
I mean, not her literal demise but her demise

884
00:52:35.639 --> 00:52:38.360
in the company. And it's just, it's just so

885
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:41.929
funny. Oh my God, the only story that I

886
00:52:41.939 --> 00:52:44.979
can think of where those two things play together

887
00:52:44.989 --> 00:52:47.379
in this sort of like Escher like way. You

888
00:52:47.389 --> 00:52:47.699
know,

889
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:50.870
now let me just say and you're probably going

890
00:52:50.879 --> 00:52:55.649
to laugh at this. But uh when you describe

891
00:52:55.659 --> 00:52:59.850
the character uh uh as being uh a guy

892
00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.840
who wanted for uh things to be always the

893
00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:06.600
same way. It, it, it this is for you

894
00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:08.699
to uh to try to see, to have a

895
00:53:08.709 --> 00:53:12.030
glimpse at how my mind works. What came to

896
00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.610
my mind, someone who has, who likes to have

897
00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:20.189
control over everything around them. And then the two

898
00:53:20.199 --> 00:53:25.260
stories that came to my mind, Citizen Kane and

899
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:27.699
50 shades of Gray. I

900
00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:32.399
got two stories that can possibly be more different,

901
00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:32.919
right?

902
00:53:33.129 --> 00:53:35.030
But this is just for you to see how

903
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.110
my mind works.

904
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:40.310
I think that's a good line.

905
00:53:41.629 --> 00:53:44.389
Oh my God, this would probably make for a,

906
00:53:44.399 --> 00:53:48.520
a good uh stand up plot.

907
00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:51.590
So I was thinking about Citizen Kane and 50

908
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.290
shades of gray came to mind.

909
00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.189
Yeah. Rosebud has everything to do with B Ds

910
00:53:59.229 --> 00:54:04.060
M for sure. Yeah. Oh my

911
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:07.250
God. You know, the, the, I hope I haven't

912
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:09.050
mentioned this on one of our conversations because I

913
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:10.790
think we did talk about 50 shades of grey

914
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.310
at one point. But I, I thought the most

915
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.189
interesting thing about the 50 shades of grey phenomenon

916
00:54:17.199 --> 00:54:22.179
came out of the prison system. Oh, really? Yes.

917
00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:26.520
Um, I read this, this was back when, like,

918
00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.699
this was back when 50 shades of grey was

919
00:54:28.709 --> 00:54:30.340
kind of first out and it was first a

920
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:34.810
huge phenomenon and everybody was reading it. And, um,

921
00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:41.030
the, the article that I was reading, the writer

922
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.459
focused on the fact that in men's prisons it

923
00:54:44.469 --> 00:54:48.239
was number one, what men were reading in prisons

924
00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:51.489
and in women's prisons, it, it didn't even crack

925
00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.500
the top 10, maybe not even the top 20

926
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.229
which is sort of the opposite of what was

927
00:54:56.239 --> 00:54:59.270
happening outside of prison. Right. And as I was

928
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.560
reading it, I was thinking, well, that makes sense

929
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:05.419
because those women are in prison probably because they

930
00:55:05.429 --> 00:55:07.110
killed the son of a bitch just like this

931
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.550
guy. You know what I mean? They're used to

932
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.340
being treated that way and they don't glamorize it,

933
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:16.629
you know, they're like, you know what, when I

934
00:55:16.639 --> 00:55:20.330
look at Christian Gray, I think, Mark or whatever,

935
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:22.860
you know? And, but I just thought that was

936
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:27.290
so interesting that, um, that, you know, women in

937
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.360
prison weren't reading it that they had, they, they

938
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:30.239
weren't interested in

939
00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:31.649
it. But, you know,

940
00:55:33.149 --> 00:55:35.679
the men were definitely reading 50 shades of gray.

941
00:55:35.959 --> 00:55:36.199
But,

942
00:55:36.389 --> 00:55:39.459
but, you know, may maybe the minority of prison

943
00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:43.649
women or prisoners, female prisoners that were reading 50

944
00:55:43.659 --> 00:55:47.070
shades of gray were the ones that those kinds

945
00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:52.929
of people where they, uh, like to get angry

946
00:55:52.939 --> 00:55:55.219
at the story. Oh, come on, I will keep

947
00:55:55.229 --> 00:55:58.260
reading or watching this because this is making me

948
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.939
angry.

949
00:55:59.949 --> 00:56:02.310
It's true. And it's, it's funny because there's this

950
00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.639
one, uh review that went, you know, viral on

951
00:56:06.649 --> 00:56:08.989
goodreads of 50 shades of gray. That was so

952
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.570
funny. I mean, it was like crying funny, laugh

953
00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:15.909
out loud, funny. Um, AND she was a hater,

954
00:56:15.919 --> 00:56:18.229
you know, she, she and her brother were reading

955
00:56:18.239 --> 00:56:20.139
it out loud to each other hating on it.

956
00:56:20.149 --> 00:56:22.870
And, you know, haters can just be so funny

957
00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:26.020
though sometimes. So it was just, it was really,

958
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:29.939
really good. Um, YOU know, speaking of haters, I,

959
00:56:29.949 --> 00:56:35.459
when we were talking about, um, stories that go

960
00:56:35.469 --> 00:56:42.560
kind of that, that perhaps betray readers expectations or

961
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:46.780
defy readers' expectations, I was thinking about, um, the

962
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:49.810
Star Wars Universe and I'm, I don't know if

963
00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.580
you're a Star Wars fan. I am not well

964
00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:54.679
versed in this. I saw the first three, you

965
00:56:54.689 --> 00:56:56.469
know, the ones that came out in the seventies

966
00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:58.560
and I love them as a kid, but I

967
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:01.129
did not, I have not followed the series since

968
00:57:01.139 --> 00:57:03.850
then, since then. But what has been interesting to

969
00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:07.489
me is how angry Star Wars fans are at

970
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:14.679
Disney for how they, you know, took, I apparently

971
00:57:14.689 --> 00:57:18.469
took the story sideways and, um, did not, uh

972
00:57:18.479 --> 00:57:22.979
give readers what they were or readers, readers watchers,

973
00:57:22.989 --> 00:57:26.060
um, what they were hoping for.

974
00:57:26.429 --> 00:57:29.530
And it's also, it's also funny because if you

975
00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:34.129
go on the internet, sometimes there's ongoing wars between

976
00:57:34.139 --> 00:57:37.939
different fandoms and, and then, and then people vote

977
00:57:37.949 --> 00:57:44.649
on what's the most toxic phantom out. It's, it's

978
00:57:44.659 --> 00:57:47.870
like, oh my God, the Harry Potter fans versus

979
00:57:47.879 --> 00:57:50.070
the Lord of the Rings fans and the Star

980
00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.469
Wars fans versus the, the Star Trek fans and

981
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:57.550
the other sci-fi universes. And then it's George RR

982
00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:01.639
Martin versus Tolkien versus whoever. And it's, it's

983
00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.179
such, it's a trail.

984
00:58:04.409 --> 00:58:08.149
Yeah. So, uh le let me ask you another

985
00:58:08.159 --> 00:58:11.370
kind of question that I think is it's something

986
00:58:11.379 --> 00:58:16.320
that even over this is our 6th, 5th or

987
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:20.939
sixth conversation. I lost count by knowledge. But all

988
00:58:20.949 --> 00:58:23.729
I know is that I now like need glasses

989
00:58:23.739 --> 00:58:26.540
to see you clearly. Well, not when I, when

990
00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:28.919
I'm, when I sit back and I didn't when

991
00:58:28.929 --> 00:58:30.310
we first started. How's that?

992
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:35.290
Well, I also have some white hairs on my

993
00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:38.090
beard now and five years ago. Yeah.

994
00:58:39.139 --> 00:58:40.699
Well, they're a little blurry to me so I

995
00:58:40.709 --> 00:58:42.459
don't see them I just see a nice lush.

996
00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.379
Yeah, probably on camera. It's hard to see them

997
00:58:45.389 --> 00:58:48.350
but I it, it's very easy to notice them

998
00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:54.370
in, in person. Anyway. Are there any things when

999
00:58:54.379 --> 00:58:57.770
you're writing a story that you just think to

1000
00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:02.199
yourself? Ok. So I would never go there. There

1001
00:59:02.209 --> 00:59:09.070
is for example, describing the very tiniest details of

1002
00:59:09.649 --> 00:59:14.629
a crime or I don't know, exploring topics that

1003
00:59:14.639 --> 00:59:19.590
you think are uh too immoral to explore in

1004
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:25.360
a story or perhaps creating characters that have specific

1005
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:28.195
idea is that you, that you think are too

1006
00:59:28.205 --> 00:59:32.435
immoral. I mean, do, do you set any moral

1007
00:59:32.445 --> 00:59:37.225
limits to what you would explore in the story

1008
00:59:37.385 --> 00:59:37.655
or

1009
00:59:37.925 --> 00:59:41.245
not? Not that I know of because I think

1010
00:59:41.254 --> 00:59:46.929
that it's, it's about, you know, how, how that

1011
00:59:46.939 --> 00:59:50.750
is done. I mean, I don't, I, I can't

1012
00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:58.750
imagine ever writing something that genuinely glorify something grotesque

1013
00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.290
and doing it in a way that is, you

1014
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:07.610
know, obviously an endorsement, let's put it that way.

1015
01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:11.360
You know what I mean? Excuse me, I, all

1016
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:17.020
allergies are upon me but II, I can't think

1017
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.340
of anything that I absolutely wouldn't address. I always

1018
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:24.060
thought that I couldn't address a child being hurt,

1019
01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:26.620
uh especially being a mother. That's really difficult. I

1020
01:00:26.629 --> 01:00:31.969
mean, it is really, really difficult. It's, you know,

1021
01:00:31.979 --> 01:00:33.439
in the same way that it's, uh, it's also

1022
01:00:33.449 --> 01:00:37.260
hard for me like to watch an, you know,

1023
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:39.610
a dog being hurt, you know, an animal being

1024
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:44.060
hurt in that way, but I did address it

1025
01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.159
in a book and that kind of surprised me

1026
01:00:46.169 --> 01:00:48.570
and I, and I did it because I realized

1027
01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.129
that I'd set up the story in such a

1028
01:00:50.139 --> 01:00:53.649
way that I had to address it. I couldn't

1029
01:00:53.659 --> 01:00:59.040
leave it. I didn't get into, um, I didn't,

1030
01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:01.000
you know, I didn't make a meal of it.

1031
01:01:02.899 --> 01:01:06.520
Um, AND not that maybe that III I, I'm

1032
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:07.889
not saying that it would be bad to do

1033
01:01:07.899 --> 01:01:12.929
that in all circumstances, but that's just not something

1034
01:01:12.939 --> 01:01:15.800
that I wanted to do at all. But I

1035
01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:18.610
realized that I did have to address it because,

1036
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:21.050
um, it was a sit, it was a war

1037
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:25.419
situation and a child was, excuse me, I'm sorry.

1038
01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:28.739
And the child was killed. And, um, and it

1039
01:01:28.750 --> 01:01:31.540
was in a, in a, a pretty awful way

1040
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:35.270
and by a pretty awful person. But, um, but

1041
01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:41.649
I felt like I, I was shirking a responsibility

1042
01:01:41.659 --> 01:01:45.370
to the reader if I didn't address that, um,

1043
01:01:47.129 --> 01:01:49.610
the reader was invested in this story, was invested

1044
01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.149
in the child. And also it was necessary for

1045
01:01:52.159 --> 01:01:57.729
the development of another character, for that to happen

1046
01:01:57.739 --> 01:02:01.080
to them, you know, and for, I, I had

1047
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:05.719
to create a circumstance that was awful enough that

1048
01:02:05.729 --> 01:02:09.239
it would propel the story to where it needed

1049
01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:15.389
to go if that makes sense. Um, SO, and

1050
01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:18.270
I, not for any moral reason, I don't think

1051
01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.699
it's, it's ne it's necessarily immoral to um, depict,

1052
01:02:23.989 --> 01:02:28.010
uh, you know, a, a child being hurt or

1053
01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.550
killed. I think that it de depends entirely upon

1054
01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.379
context. But I never thought that I would write

1055
01:02:34.389 --> 01:02:36.340
it because I thought it would just be too

1056
01:02:36.659 --> 01:02:39.659
difficult and it was very difficult to write for

1057
01:02:39.669 --> 01:02:42.209
me. I avoided it for days because I knew

1058
01:02:42.219 --> 01:02:44.580
I had to write that scene and I, you

1059
01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:47.330
know, oh, I'll do some admin today. Well, I,

1060
01:02:47.449 --> 01:02:49.969
I have to write, um, um, I'll write an

1061
01:02:49.979 --> 01:02:52.679
essay on Family Law, you know, whatever it is.

1062
01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:59.840
I, I really, I avoided it in a pretty

1063
01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:02.770
egregious way for several days until I finally sat

1064
01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.889
down and said this is ridiculous. This has to

1065
01:03:04.899 --> 01:03:07.320
get written and I'm gonna do it and it

1066
01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:11.649
was such a relief to get it done. It's

1067
01:03:11.659 --> 01:03:14.510
hard. I mean, it's very hard to write certain,

1068
01:03:15.699 --> 01:03:19.040
yeah. Uh, TO write about certain topics and scenes.

1069
01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:20.689
I mean, it, it is really hard.

1070
01:03:20.889 --> 01:03:23.389
Ok. So let, let me ask you then another

1071
01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:28.659
question related to that. Have you ever read or

1072
01:03:28.669 --> 01:03:35.250
watched something fictional? Of course, where you fought? O

1073
01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:40.469
ok. So the author, the author here went too

1074
01:03:40.479 --> 01:03:45.229
far. I mean, this is just too graphic, too

1075
01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:50.719
detailed, too violent. Have you ever, ever, has anything

1076
01:03:50.729 --> 01:03:55.139
like that ever happened to you? No,

1077
01:03:56.770 --> 01:04:00.649
not in something I've read. But there is, this

1078
01:04:00.659 --> 01:04:04.010
a long time ago, there is a book that

1079
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.600
I read, which was a sequel. It was the

1080
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:12.139
sequel to, um, was the book Hannibal, it was

1081
01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:15.760
the sequel to Silence of The Lambs. But the

1082
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:17.949
book version where I read it and I thought,

1083
01:04:17.959 --> 01:04:20.870
what the hell is this? Do you know what

1084
01:04:20.879 --> 01:04:26.469
I mean? Um So, you know, it, I, I

1085
01:04:26.479 --> 01:04:29.699
really felt like I felt like the author had

1086
01:04:29.709 --> 01:04:31.899
gone off the rails and was writing like a

1087
01:04:31.909 --> 01:04:36.439
weird fantasy of theirs and not, what was this?

1088
01:04:36.449 --> 01:04:39.159
Not the story that he had originally written book,

1089
01:04:39.169 --> 01:04:42.979
it's his story. So, just by definition, I'm wrong,

1090
01:04:42.989 --> 01:04:47.409
right? But as, as a reader, I felt like

1091
01:04:47.419 --> 01:04:53.840
he did not, um, that I felt like he'd

1092
01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.120
gone off the rails and not in a grotesque

1093
01:04:56.129 --> 01:04:58.050
sort of way. Not like, oh, I don't want

1094
01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.030
to read that but, you know what the hell

1095
01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.149
kind of way. But no, I've never read anything

1096
01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:10.860
that I can remember that. Um, THAT I couldn't

1097
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:15.959
get through. I think often if you are absorbed

1098
01:05:15.969 --> 01:05:17.840
enough in a story, well, one of two things

1099
01:05:17.850 --> 01:05:19.850
can happen. You might love a character so much

1100
01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.070
that you're like, oh my God, I know they're

1101
01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.739
gonna die and I can't read that. You know,

1102
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:26.560
you, you, you skip ahead a few pages, you

1103
01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:30.219
know what happened, you accept it but you just,

1104
01:05:30.229 --> 01:05:32.610
you just can't go there. I understand that. But

1105
01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:39.149
usually in what I'm reading, um, when I'm absorbed

1106
01:05:39.159 --> 01:05:42.090
enough in a story, I can take it and

1107
01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:46.969
I can understand why the author put it there

1108
01:05:46.979 --> 01:05:50.800
in the first place and why, um why I

1109
01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:54.530
have to be taken through that in order to,

1110
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:58.270
you know, get to the other side, you know,

1111
01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.040
the other part of the story kind of like

1112
01:06:00.050 --> 01:06:01.659
what I described with what I felt like I

1113
01:06:01.669 --> 01:06:04.300
had when I had to put in, you know,

1114
01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:07.229
a difficult scene about a child being killed. Um

1115
01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:10.729
I, I put it there because I really didn't

1116
01:06:10.739 --> 01:06:16.340
see any other way for the story to evolve,

1117
01:06:16.350 --> 01:06:17.939
you know, to, to the, for the story to

1118
01:06:17.949 --> 01:06:19.489
get to the place that it needed to be.

1119
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:24.040
And usually when I'm reading something II, I feel

1120
01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:26.459
that as well that doesn't mean that there aren't

1121
01:06:27.629 --> 01:06:29.739
parts of stories that I haven't read where I've

1122
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:34.290
winced. I mean, really what comes to mind that

1123
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:42.229
was so difficult to face was, um, Styron Sophie's

1124
01:06:42.239 --> 01:06:46.689
Choice. Mhm. I don't know if you've read Sophie's

1125
01:06:46.699 --> 01:06:48.199
Choice or if you've seen the movie.

1126
01:06:48.969 --> 01:06:52.189
No, I, that one particularly, I don't think so.

1127
01:06:52.199 --> 01:06:52.419
No.

1128
01:06:52.659 --> 01:06:57.219
But, ii, I mean, the story about a woman

1129
01:06:57.229 --> 01:07:01.000
named Sophie who, um, ends up in, during World

1130
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:04.050
War Two in a concentration camp and they make,

1131
01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.110
she has two Children and they make her choose

1132
01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:10.979
which one is going to be killed. Mm. Hence

1133
01:07:10.989 --> 01:07:13.590
the title, I think they both end up being

1134
01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.610
killed. Um, BUT, you know, they do, they both

1135
01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.429
end up being killed but they make her choose

1136
01:07:19.439 --> 01:07:22.709
which is, you can, I mean, for a mother

1137
01:07:22.719 --> 01:07:29.300
that is like, it is so horrific to imagine

1138
01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:34.469
yourself in that situation that you wanna look away

1139
01:07:34.959 --> 01:07:39.610
because it's like, and III, I don't, I don't

1140
01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:43.070
even know. I don't, I mean, it would, it

1141
01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.330
would be hard for me to imagine uh, a

1142
01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:49.739
woman being able to write it. Not because she

1143
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:55.300
wouldn't have the skill, but it's, you would almost

1144
01:07:55.310 --> 01:07:58.620
need that the detachment of a man to write

1145
01:07:58.629 --> 01:08:02.040
that. Not that a man is detached from his

1146
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:04.330
Children. That's not what I mean. But it is

1147
01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:06.270
just, I mean, I can tell you as a,

1148
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:12.459
as a parent, it's so like, mm, it's a

1149
01:08:12.469 --> 01:08:19.140
whole body experience. Um I can still like, II,

1150
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:24.700
I can still physically conjure the um the, the

1151
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:26.689
feeling that I would get when my child was

1152
01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:34.330
hungry. Yeah. And again, I mean, ii, I certainly

1153
01:08:34.339 --> 01:08:36.160
think a woman could write that. I'm not saying

1154
01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:42.640
that she couldn't. But uh uh I mean, thyroid

1155
01:08:42.649 --> 01:08:46.609
just did it so, so brilliantly, you know, and

1156
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:58.020
that was fascinating and tragic and horrifying and beautiful.

1157
01:08:58.689 --> 01:08:59.200
OK. So

1158
01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:03.830
let me try to put it another way and

1159
01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:07.339
then perhaps I can give a few examples of

1160
01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:16.509
mine. Are there any stories in books, movies or

1161
01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.310
any other kind of medium that you've read, watched?

1162
01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:26.310
And uh after the fact you thought to yourself,

1163
01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:30.120
OK. So even if this is a great story

1164
01:09:30.629 --> 01:09:34.629
because of the way things are depicted, I don't

1165
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.839
feel uh is recommending, recommending it to other people.

1166
01:09:42.009 --> 01:09:46.200
Have you ever had something like that or? I've,

1167
01:09:46.209 --> 01:09:53.450
I've, I'm not sure I put it quite that

1168
01:09:53.459 --> 01:09:55.529
way. Like, I mean, there's certainly stories where I

1169
01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:59.770
disagreed with the premise, maybe with their historical premise

1170
01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:04.720
or with a moral ambiguity that, um, that, that

1171
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:11.740
the story, um, depicted, you know, I definitely, but

1172
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:13.709
I would never, I don't think there, that I

1173
01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.740
would ever go so far as to say, um,

1174
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:19.540
well, don't read that because of it where I

1175
01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:21.939
wouldn't recommend it. I'd, I'd say, well, it's interesting

1176
01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:25.669
but here's what I think, you know. Um I,

1177
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.299
so I guess I don't, my answer is, I

1178
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:34.910
don't think so. I can't, I can't conjure something,

1179
01:10:34.919 --> 01:10:39.319
you know, a memory of a time when I've,

1180
01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:43.319
when I've read something and said I'm so offended

1181
01:10:43.330 --> 01:10:47.379
by this. I think it shouldn't be or I

1182
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:51.189
would, I would discourage people from reading it. I

1183
01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:53.790
told people when something really sucked, you know.

1184
01:10:55.859 --> 01:10:58.819
Yeah. But, but that's, that's a different, that's a

1185
01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:03.040
different kind of thing. But uh I wasn't thinking

1186
01:11:03.049 --> 01:11:09.430
perhaps uh so much as being offended, but perhaps

1187
01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:15.060
more as OK, so perhaps the guy here, the

1188
01:11:15.069 --> 01:11:21.290
creator went too far in terms of the, the

1189
01:11:21.299 --> 01:11:25.479
things graphically. And uh I mean, I don't think

1190
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:30.600
I would feel well recommending the II, I was

1191
01:11:30.609 --> 01:11:33.229
able to go through it. I still think it's

1192
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.120
a good story, but I wouldn't feel well recommending

1193
01:11:37.129 --> 01:11:40.470
this to anyone because even if the story is

1194
01:11:40.479 --> 01:11:44.240
good, I don't think that people would be particularly

1195
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:48.470
enriched by being exposed to it. Something like that.

1196
01:11:49.479 --> 01:11:53.180
I, I can't, I can't come up with an

1197
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:56.259
example of that. I mean, if, if, if I

1198
01:11:56.270 --> 01:12:01.229
felt that I don't remember, I don't remember the

1199
01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.649
story and I think I would probably, if I

1200
01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:05.620
felt so strongly about something I don't think so.

1201
01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:07.410
Have you like, is there a story that you've

1202
01:12:07.419 --> 01:12:09.930
read where you're like, wow, he, he or she

1203
01:12:09.939 --> 01:12:12.850
should not have gone there? That was too much?

1204
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.629
Ok. So I'm going to explain to you what

1205
01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:19.410
happened here over the course of my life basically.

1206
01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:23.500
So probably until 10 years ago, I was one

1207
01:12:23.509 --> 01:12:27.229
of those people that was like, ok, so you

1208
01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.779
should be exposed to great art of, of any

1209
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:35.939
kind. And it doesn't matter if it makes you

1210
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:39.259
feel unwell, if it makes you feel a little

1211
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:42.979
bit sick, even if it's good art, you should

1212
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:48.020
be exposed to it. But then, um, for example,

1213
01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:53.120
uh I watched the anti-christ by Lars Von Drier.

1214
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:55.720
I don't know if you ever watched that one.

1215
01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:59.339
Uh And I was like, I mean, it was

1216
01:12:59.350 --> 01:13:02.899
very hard to go through it, particularly the last

1217
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:06.080
20 minutes or something like that. But I went

1218
01:13:06.089 --> 01:13:08.220
through it and I, I mean, I've never had

1219
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:11.970
myself, uh, I, I was never exposed to any

1220
01:13:11.979 --> 01:13:15.439
story where I was like, ok, so I have

1221
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:18.240
to stop here. I can't go further. I can't

1222
01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.720
take it anymore. That, that never happened to me

1223
01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:24.520
personally. But then I tried to show to watch

1224
01:13:24.529 --> 01:13:28.240
it together with a couple of friends from university

1225
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:33.509
back then. And one of them accidentally accidentally skipped

1226
01:13:33.759 --> 01:13:37.390
the movie to one of the most violent scenes.

1227
01:13:37.399 --> 01:13:39.729
And they were like, man, I, I can, I

1228
01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.470
can, I can, I can't watch it. Sorry. Uh

1229
01:13:43.479 --> 01:13:47.060
Look, this is just too much and then the

1230
01:13:47.069 --> 01:13:50.939
same thing happened, uh when I tried to show,

1231
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:54.810
for example, my mother, a couple of movies that

1232
01:13:54.819 --> 01:13:59.569
for this or that reason, she uh uh she

1233
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:03.470
doesn't like the uh I mean, to see certain

1234
01:14:03.479 --> 01:14:08.129
kinds of things. And then, I mean, uh over

1235
01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:12.020
time I got to a point where I sort

1236
01:14:12.029 --> 01:14:16.729
of became more sensitive to the idea that perhaps

1237
01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:21.620
there are certain kinds of graphic things, perhaps not

1238
01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:24.950
so much in books, but in movies because you

1239
01:14:24.959 --> 01:14:31.029
actually see the stuff that that's happening there where

1240
01:14:31.339 --> 01:14:34.330
I, I mean, I, there are certain things that

1241
01:14:34.339 --> 01:14:40.839
I really hesitate to recommend to other people because

1242
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:44.160
one thing that I think about now that I

1243
01:14:44.169 --> 01:14:48.979
didn't consider before 10 years ago or so is

1244
01:14:49.689 --> 01:14:55.330
OK, so this is a good story but is

1245
01:14:55.339 --> 01:15:00.970
it really worth it for someone to be exposed

1246
01:15:00.979 --> 01:15:04.189
to it? I mean, if someone is not and

1247
01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.669
never watches this, uh are they, would they be

1248
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:13.000
missing on something, you know, and and, and now

1249
01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:15.140
I, and now I think like that and there,

1250
01:15:15.259 --> 01:15:18.330
and for example, the anti-christ is one of those

1251
01:15:18.339 --> 01:15:25.390
movies. Uh The adaptation of 120 Days of Sodom

1252
01:15:25.589 --> 01:15:29.689
by Pierre Paolo Paolini is another one of those

1253
01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:34.649
movies because of the sexual perversion and all of

1254
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:37.430
that. Uh AND there are, there are perhaps a

1255
01:15:37.439 --> 01:15:40.290
couple more, I mean, it, the list is still

1256
01:15:40.299 --> 01:15:43.689
very small, at least the ones, the ones that

1257
01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:47.720
immediately come to mind. But now I have, uh,

1258
01:15:47.799 --> 01:15:52.049
uh, at least a small list of things that

1259
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:57.979
look and unless people ask me directly about them,

1260
01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:02.859
I basically never mention them to anyone who is

1261
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:07.580
not at least familiar with the existence of that

1262
01:16:07.589 --> 01:16:08.899
movie. For example.

1263
01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:13.490
II, I hear what you're saying. I, um, I

1264
01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:20.629
think probably in my case, um, I, I tend

1265
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.479
to kind of do a pre emptive strike and

1266
01:16:23.490 --> 01:16:30.529
I, I will avoid something that is that I

1267
01:16:30.540 --> 01:16:33.939
just know I don't wanna see. Um, I mean,

1268
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:37.600
a good example is, and I'm not, I'm really

1269
01:16:37.609 --> 01:16:39.500
not that big a horror fan but II, I

1270
01:16:39.509 --> 01:16:41.959
think my son probably would have watched this with,

1271
01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:44.350
would have enjoyed watching it with me. There's a

1272
01:16:44.359 --> 01:16:48.839
series called Saw. Yeah. Yeah. And it's that

1273
01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:51.959
I've, I've watched, I've watched the movie. I

1274
01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:53.910
know that's not for me. I've never seen a

1275
01:16:53.919 --> 01:16:56.979
single one of them so I'm not gonna judge

1276
01:16:56.990 --> 01:17:00.540
but I know that's not for me. But what's

1277
01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:04.729
really interesting to me is, for instance, you know,

1278
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.270
I'm the movie The Exorcist. I mean, granted I

1279
01:17:09.279 --> 01:17:11.379
grew up Catholic, I went to Catholic schools, you

1280
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:14.350
know, but the movie The Exorcist was so terrifying

1281
01:17:14.359 --> 01:17:15.729
to me when I was a kid that I

1282
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:19.399
had nightmares about it into adulthood. I mean, well

1283
01:17:19.410 --> 01:17:25.040
into adulthood and my, you know, 16 year old

1284
01:17:25.049 --> 01:17:29.160
daughter who I think first saw the original Exorcist,

1285
01:17:29.569 --> 01:17:32.160
um, when she was a really little kid, all

1286
01:17:32.169 --> 01:17:33.560
three of my kids have seen it. They think

1287
01:17:33.569 --> 01:17:39.629
it's hilarious. I mean, hilarious. And they, they think

1288
01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.169
that part where she throws up the pea soup

1289
01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:44.390
is one of the funniest things they've ever seen.

1290
01:17:44.399 --> 01:17:48.069
They think the special effects are terrible. I mean,

1291
01:17:48.279 --> 01:17:52.649
the, that movie does not give them nightmares but

1292
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:53.509
a little

1293
01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.589
bit. But wait a minute if they watched the

1294
01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:03.830
scary movies before watching The Exorcist because if they

1295
01:18:03.839 --> 01:18:07.680
did, because if they did it's easier to understand

1296
01:18:07.689 --> 01:18:10.669
why they would laugh because Scary Movie two is

1297
01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:11.200
all about

1298
01:18:11.839 --> 01:18:14.529
right with James Woods and, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I've

1299
01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:17.930
seen that. Exactly. Um, MAYBE, but I think also

1300
01:18:17.939 --> 01:18:20.930
they genuinely think it's a funny movie. I mean,

1301
01:18:20.939 --> 01:18:23.759
I think they genuinely think it's kind of like,

1302
01:18:23.890 --> 01:18:28.299
like when her head spins around, you know, that

1303
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:31.319
was, that was so disturbing to me as a

1304
01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:35.189
kid to watch that. It was absolutely horrific and

1305
01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:38.020
to them they're like, that is so obviously not

1306
01:18:38.029 --> 01:18:40.910
real, you know, what I mean? And they just

1307
01:18:40.919 --> 01:18:47.229
think it's funny and, um, uh, so it, it,

1308
01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:52.830
it, I'm, I'm always intrigued by people who are

1309
01:18:52.839 --> 01:18:56.640
really into horror in this way and they don't

1310
01:18:56.649 --> 01:19:01.049
mind watching people get hacked to death and they

1311
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:08.549
are completely able to separate, um, what they're watching

1312
01:19:09.259 --> 01:19:12.040
with real life, you know, and be like mom,

1313
01:19:13.390 --> 01:19:15.410
it's not real, don't you get it? It's not

1314
01:19:15.419 --> 01:19:18.290
real. And whereas to me I'm watching it and

1315
01:19:18.299 --> 01:19:20.169
I'm like, I know it's not real but it

1316
01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:23.330
feels real. You know, I can see it and

1317
01:19:23.339 --> 01:19:26.839
then I'm imagining this in my own life, but

1318
01:19:27.209 --> 01:19:30.470
not everybody feels that way and they're, they're able

1319
01:19:30.479 --> 01:19:32.330
to make that separation. I'm not one of those

1320
01:19:32.339 --> 01:19:35.009
people. I, uh, you know, it's why I'm not,

1321
01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.089
I mean, I love a great horror movie. I

1322
01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.270
mean, I think we've talked about this, that the

1323
01:19:39.279 --> 01:19:42.399
novel Dracula is one of my favorite novels of

1324
01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:44.339
all time. I think it's so good. Well, I

1325
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:51.259
think the character is so good. Um, BUT I,

1326
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:55.189
I, you know, I could not be one of

1327
01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:59.810
those people who loves horror and can watch saw

1328
01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:04.080
and, you know, uh, the conjuring and something, you

1329
01:20:04.089 --> 01:20:06.979
know, some other horrific thing back to back or

1330
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:09.790
like those simulated snuff movies that I think that

1331
01:20:09.799 --> 01:20:12.120
is really horrific. To me, the idea, even if

1332
01:20:12.129 --> 01:20:14.939
it's, if it's acted out on film and it's

1333
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:19.580
not real. And the idea of Snuff is, that's

1334
01:20:19.589 --> 01:20:23.060
probably where I would just wanna throw up. Yeah,

1335
01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:24.740
that makes sense. Now,

1336
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:31.540
look, uh, horror, horror movies. Uh, IT, it, it

1337
01:20:31.549 --> 01:20:34.459
might be weird but, uh, even when it comes

1338
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:37.410
to the list of movies that I don't recommend

1339
01:20:37.419 --> 01:20:41.419
to anyone, not one of them, apart from perhaps

1340
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:44.140
the anti-christ, I'm not sure if it's classified as

1341
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:46.959
a horror movie or not. But apart from that

1342
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:51.310
one, there's not one single horror movie there. So

1343
01:20:51.319 --> 01:20:53.950
horror movies, I, I don't say that I'm a

1344
01:20:53.959 --> 01:20:58.350
horror movie fan. I've watched a ton of them

1345
01:20:58.470 --> 01:21:01.759
just because until, until a few years ago I

1346
01:21:01.770 --> 01:21:06.490
was addicted to movies. And so I've watched everything

1347
01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:12.549
out there, even the 19 eighties slasher movies, I've

1348
01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.569
watched all of them and most of them do

1349
01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:18.250
not bother me at all. Some of them make

1350
01:21:18.259 --> 01:21:21.779
me feel a little bit uneasy but not sick

1351
01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:24.549
nor anything like that. So, but, but I, I'm

1352
01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:28.080
not, I wouldn't say I'm a horror movie fan

1353
01:21:28.089 --> 01:21:30.209
but, uh, I, I mean, I guess that the

1354
01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:33.060
things that perhaps when it comes to recommending them

1355
01:21:33.069 --> 01:21:36.649
to other people bother me the most. It's when

1356
01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:42.890
it, it involves things that can actually happen realistically

1357
01:21:42.899 --> 01:21:47.609
in real life, you know, like, like for example,

1358
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:51.419
what happens in the anti-christ that could happen in

1359
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:57.669
real life, the sexual perversions in 120 days of

1360
01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:03.379
sodom and uh uh uh uh oh, have you

1361
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:09.770
watched here Irreversible By Gaspar Noe with Monica Bellucci

1362
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:16.750
uh yeah, so that movie involves uh a, a

1363
01:22:16.759 --> 01:22:23.580
very hard to go through rapes in, I mean,

1364
01:22:23.589 --> 01:22:23.779
that

1365
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:25.919
would be, that would be difficult. I mean, I,

1366
01:22:25.930 --> 01:22:27.879
I would never go so far as to say,

1367
01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:29.589
you know, that, that it shouldn't be a movie

1368
01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.589
or anything like that, but there are definitely things

1369
01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.180
that I would avoid because to me they don't

1370
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.770
have value

1371
01:22:35.779 --> 01:22:39.490
and, and for example, just a few minutes ago

1372
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.154
I mentioned Tony. So I know and in the

1373
01:22:42.165 --> 01:22:44.705
Sopranos, there's also a rape scene. I don't know

1374
01:22:44.714 --> 01:22:47.365
if you remember this. But there's one episode where

1375
01:22:47.375 --> 01:22:53.015
his female therapist is uh leaving her office and

1376
01:22:53.024 --> 01:22:55.444
she's raped by a guy. I can't remember exactly

1377
01:22:55.455 --> 01:22:57.944
who the guy was. And I think that Tony

1378
01:22:57.955 --> 01:23:02.604
Soprano eventually gets across that and kills the guy.

1379
01:23:02.615 --> 01:23:05.794
Iii I can't remember. I can't remember exactly. But

1380
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:09.689
uh I mean, uh that 10 of course, it's

1381
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:13.879
always hard to watch those kinds of scenes. Always,

1382
01:23:13.890 --> 01:23:16.620
at least for me personally, it's always because I,

1383
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:20.450
I feel my blood boiling because I get really

1384
01:23:20.459 --> 01:23:24.839
angry just imagining something like that happening in front

1385
01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:27.520
of me. And it really messes me up at

1386
01:23:27.529 --> 01:23:31.850
least for a few minutes. But that one actually,

1387
01:23:31.859 --> 01:23:36.390
I don't have any problem recommending the entire Sopranos

1388
01:23:36.399 --> 01:23:39.770
series to anyone even with that scene and with

1389
01:23:39.779 --> 01:23:42.419
other stuff, I don't have any problem at all,

1390
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:48.350
but irreversible. I think that they just went too

1391
01:23:48.359 --> 01:23:50.970
far there. I mean, even I, myself, I watched

1392
01:23:50.979 --> 01:23:55.569
the movie once and I can't watch the movie

1393
01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.100
again ever again.

1394
01:23:57.509 --> 01:24:01.229
So I think probably for me what is, what

1395
01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:08.970
would be, uh, a line crosser is if a

1396
01:24:08.979 --> 01:24:15.169
movie was too nihilistic, um, and cease to have

1397
01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:21.859
any moral dimension because I think, I think our

1398
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:25.700
lives have a moral dimension, you know, and, and

1399
01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:32.759
I, it's also just deeply disturbing to watch something

1400
01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:38.919
like that and be able to, um, uh, be

1401
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:43.189
able to take any value from that and apply

1402
01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.009
it to my own life, which I think is

1403
01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:47.470
why I read and it's why I write. It's

1404
01:24:47.479 --> 01:24:49.620
why I watch movies. I mean, ultimately it's why

1405
01:24:49.629 --> 01:24:53.370
I consume art. It's to be, um, enriched in

1406
01:24:53.379 --> 01:24:56.990
some way. And if I don't find it enriching,

1407
01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.830
it's funny you should mention The Sopranos because I

1408
01:24:58.839 --> 01:25:00.839
too would recommend that series to anyone. But I

1409
01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:05.919
remember when I stopped watching it, um, and I,

1410
01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:10.370
I may have been pregnant at the time. It's

1411
01:25:10.379 --> 01:25:13.279
kind of funny because when I'm, when, whenever I

1412
01:25:13.290 --> 01:25:15.500
was, I was pregnant, there were certain things I

1413
01:25:15.509 --> 01:25:18.270
could not watch and I could not, I mean,

1414
01:25:18.279 --> 01:25:20.680
I just couldn't, I mean, I, I remember in

1415
01:25:20.779 --> 01:25:23.060
one of my pregnancies kill Bill came out, by

1416
01:25:23.069 --> 01:25:24.500
the way, I love Kill Bill. I watch it

1417
01:25:24.509 --> 01:25:27.850
now. You know what I mean? I couldn't watch

1418
01:25:27.859 --> 01:25:31.990
it. I mean, I couldn't, and, um, I remember

1419
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.799
an episode of The Sopranos and I I have

1420
01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:38.509
not from that episode on, I, I never finished

1421
01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:44.450
the series. It was a young woman who was

1422
01:25:44.459 --> 01:25:46.850
a stripper at one of Tony's clubs and she

1423
01:25:46.859 --> 01:25:51.390
was pregnant with this awful guy's kid and he

1424
01:25:51.399 --> 01:25:54.229
beat her to death. Do you remember the scene?

1425
01:25:56.330 --> 01:25:59.919
That was so disturbing to me that, and I

1426
01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:02.290
knew that that guy was eventually gonna get it.

1427
01:26:02.299 --> 01:26:04.740
You know, there, there was a moral dimension to

1428
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:09.419
the Sopranos actually. You know, but I, I'm pretty

1429
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:11.549
sure I was pregnant when I watched that. Um,

1430
01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:15.950
BECAUSE I, I just couldn't, you know, I just

1431
01:26:15.959 --> 01:26:20.790
couldn't go beyond that. Um, AND not in a

1432
01:26:20.799 --> 01:26:23.779
judgmental way. I, I just couldn't watch it because

1433
01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:28.350
it, you know, it was so, uh, it was

1434
01:26:28.359 --> 01:26:32.620
disturbing to me on, on such a deep level.

1435
01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.899
Ok. So, II I made me

1436
01:26:35.979 --> 01:26:38.350
physically ill. I mean, I remember it made me

1437
01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:39.589
physically ill. Yeah.

1438
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:46.169
OK. So perhaps, uh, 01 of the things that

1439
01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:50.919
bother me when it comes to how certain things

1440
01:26:50.930 --> 01:26:57.180
are sometimes depicted is if you really need to

1441
01:26:57.189 --> 01:27:00.020
do it that way or go that far because

1442
01:27:00.029 --> 01:27:03.850
for example, in the Sopranos, the rape scene, you

1443
01:27:03.859 --> 01:27:07.379
see some of it, but most of it is

1444
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:14.580
suggested, you know, in irreversible, it's not suggested at

1445
01:27:14.589 --> 01:27:15.229
all.

1446
01:27:16.169 --> 01:27:16.669
I don't think

1447
01:27:17.049 --> 01:27:20.839
it's all there. And one thing that bothers me

1448
01:27:20.850 --> 01:27:24.200
about that, it's not just the morality of it,

1449
01:27:24.209 --> 01:27:29.580
but I, I, in, I wonder whether it's telling

1450
01:27:29.589 --> 01:27:33.259
me that perhaps the author, the director, the writer,

1451
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:38.020
whoever is not that great at directing or writing

1452
01:27:38.029 --> 01:27:42.950
because for, for me, someone who's really good at,

1453
01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:47.759
uh for example, making, making someone feeling disgusted at

1454
01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:50.740
the rape scene does not have to show it

1455
01:27:50.759 --> 01:27:52.529
all the,

1456
01:27:52.959 --> 01:27:55.729
I agree. I, I, and I, and I, and

1457
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:56.799
I think the level of

1458
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:59.729
disgust and I think it, and I think someone

1459
01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:03.140
is a better writer if, uh for example, when

1460
01:28:03.149 --> 01:28:06.890
it comes to books or, I mean, there's that

1461
01:28:06.899 --> 01:28:11.189
idea of you show don't tell, right show don't

1462
01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.750
tell. In the case of movies, I would say

1463
01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:20.310
because it's all showing uh you show but not

1464
01:28:20.319 --> 01:28:23.410
too much. Are you sure? But you're not uh

1465
01:28:23.419 --> 01:28:27.140
describe, I mean, in, in that case, it's not

1466
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:32.120
describing but it's showing uh everything down, down to

1467
01:28:32.459 --> 01:28:35.049
the details. Uh I

1468
01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:35.899
agree with that

1469
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:38.040
and I, and I, and I think that perhaps

1470
01:28:38.049 --> 01:28:42.080
there are times that's just too much, it's not

1471
01:28:42.089 --> 01:28:45.720
needed. It's, it's just that's not needed to convey

1472
01:28:45.729 --> 01:28:49.020
the same kind of, or, or to create the

1473
01:28:49.029 --> 01:28:53.930
same kind of reaction in viewers or readers.

1474
01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.330
I would agree with that. I mean, it's funny,

1475
01:28:56.339 --> 01:29:00.629
I was talking about this with, um, with a

1476
01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.540
writer friend. Uh This is some time ago but

1477
01:29:04.549 --> 01:29:10.319
when uh I sat down to write um this

1478
01:29:10.330 --> 01:29:14.500
historical fantasy series, uh breath some years ago when

1479
01:29:14.509 --> 01:29:16.790
I started it, um you know, it has a,

1480
01:29:16.799 --> 01:29:22.609
a, a central love story to it. And at,

1481
01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:25.069
you know, at the time, and I think this

1482
01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:30.649
is largely still the case, really kind of explicit

1483
01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:33.520
love scenes had made their way into just about

1484
01:29:33.529 --> 01:29:37.839
every genre historical fiction. And, you know, it, it

1485
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:42.240
had, you know, left the confines of erotica and

1486
01:29:42.250 --> 01:29:44.419
it was in science fiction, it was in historical

1487
01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:46.479
fiction, it was in, in pretty much every kind

1488
01:29:46.490 --> 01:29:50.330
of fiction. And I decided that I was not

1489
01:29:50.339 --> 01:29:52.740
gonna do that. I decided that I was gonna

1490
01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:56.589
have a very sensual love story and have it

1491
01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:01.700
be, um, you know, hopefully very emotional and very

1492
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:05.450
compelling, but that I, that I was gonna have

1493
01:30:05.459 --> 01:30:12.500
a fade to black approach. And I'm glad I

1494
01:30:12.509 --> 01:30:15.410
did that because I'm, I'm for one, I'm really

1495
01:30:15.419 --> 01:30:19.700
sick of being bombarded by explicit love scenes at

1496
01:30:19.709 --> 01:30:24.200
this point. I feel like, um they're just there

1497
01:30:30.319 --> 01:30:32.399
because I don't know, maybe the writer feels like

1498
01:30:32.410 --> 01:30:34.350
they need to put it in there to attract

1499
01:30:34.359 --> 01:30:37.399
the reader's attention. Um And that we just keep

1500
01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:40.640
having to up the ante with these scenes and

1501
01:30:40.649 --> 01:30:43.339
with these stories because it's now it's just not

1502
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:47.169
enough to have, you know, a passionate kiss or

1503
01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:50.680
even like, or, or even, you know, regular sort

1504
01:30:50.689 --> 01:30:56.209
of um sex that doesn't involve all sorts of

1505
01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:00.750
tricks. And after a certain point, it's like, really,

1506
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:03.149
I, I mean, it, it's sort of like when,

1507
01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.680
you know, that the James Bond franchise has to

1508
01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:08.299
scale back, you know, like with the Roger Moore

1509
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:10.399
ones when they started going to space and all

1510
01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:13.109
this stuff, it's like, no. Yeah. And they've kind

1511
01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.160
of got to bring it back to a place

1512
01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:18.589
where look, ok, now he's just using his fists

1513
01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.955
and his gun. He's not gonna be in space.

1514
01:31:20.964 --> 01:31:23.535
He's not gonna be doing anything, you know, we're

1515
01:31:23.544 --> 01:31:25.575
not going to be going to the paranormal. We're

1516
01:31:25.584 --> 01:31:28.964
not gonna make him do things that, that don't

1517
01:31:28.975 --> 01:31:32.544
in any way seem realistic for this, you know,

1518
01:31:32.555 --> 01:31:35.104
and now 56 year old man for God's sake

1519
01:31:35.115 --> 01:31:40.279
with bad knees probably. Um So I, you know,

1520
01:31:40.290 --> 01:31:44.890
that's, that's something that I, that, that I've come

1521
01:31:44.899 --> 01:31:48.669
to feel strongly about. I think that um I

1522
01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:52.890
think that the depiction of sex has just gotten

1523
01:31:52.899 --> 01:31:55.910
ridiculous, but in a lot of, a lot of

1524
01:31:55.919 --> 01:31:58.470
stories and not because I'm prudish about it. It's,

1525
01:31:58.479 --> 01:32:01.470
I'm not, it's just I'm bored by it, you

1526
01:32:01.479 --> 01:32:04.569
know, and, and I feel like we're constantly having

1527
01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:06.899
to add more whipped cream and more cherries and

1528
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:09.399
more chocolate sauce and more peanut sprinkles and then

1529
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:11.339
the colorful confetti sprinkles.

1530
01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.890
Yeah. No, but, but, but you know what, when

1531
01:32:15.899 --> 01:32:20.140
it comes to uh love scenes, sex scenes, whatever,

1532
01:32:20.589 --> 01:32:25.180
I mean, I don't have a particular problem uh

1533
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:29.689
in the way they are graphically depicted in more

1534
01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:33.040
or less detail. I mean, perhaps sometimes I would

1535
01:32:33.049 --> 01:32:36.779
say, OK, so this is perhaps uh no longer

1536
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:41.524
just a romance novel, this is perhaps already pornography

1537
01:32:41.535 --> 01:32:44.345
or something like that. But if people are into

1538
01:32:44.354 --> 01:32:47.334
pornography fine, I mean, I don't, I don't,

1539
01:32:47.765 --> 01:32:49.535
I don't have a moral problem with it in

1540
01:32:49.584 --> 01:32:51.555
that regard. I don't have, I'm not prudish about

1541
01:32:51.564 --> 01:32:55.674
it. But the, the thing, for example, about irreversible

1542
01:32:55.685 --> 01:32:59.819
and 120 days of sodom is that, I mean,

1543
01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:04.069
in 120 days of sodom, I mean, it involves

1544
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:08.169
things that I wouldn't even mention here because this

1545
01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:11.549
will also be on youtube. And it's just too

1546
01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.379
much just to say that it's too much, even

1547
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:20.899
for people that watch regular porn, it's just too

1548
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:21.649
much

1549
01:33:21.859 --> 01:33:24.930
because it goes beyond gratuitous.

1550
01:33:25.049 --> 01:33:29.729
Yeah. And the, and then, and then adding, yeah,

1551
01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:33.109
and then adding the ribs in an irreversible, I

1552
01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.799
mean, sometimes I find myself asking, I mean, isn't

1553
01:33:38.810 --> 01:33:42.540
this wrong? I mean, and by wrong, I'm not

1554
01:33:42.549 --> 01:33:47.479
sure if I mean, morally wrong or artistically wrong

1555
01:33:47.490 --> 01:33:52.810
either because perhaps you shouldn't expose people to so

1556
01:33:52.819 --> 01:33:57.390
much graphic stuff because it, it feels sort of

1557
01:33:57.399 --> 01:34:01.350
wrong or because as an artist, you don't need

1558
01:34:01.359 --> 01:34:04.140
to go that far. And so perhaps you're not

1559
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:07.640
as great an artist as you think you are

1560
01:34:07.649 --> 01:34:10.229
or as you could be. And, and, and another

1561
01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.200
thing that comes to mind and that when I

1562
01:34:12.209 --> 01:34:17.169
really straight out say that it's morally or was

1563
01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:20.939
morally wrong, for example, back in 20 I want

1564
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:25.819
to say 2015, possibly 2016, there was an, an

1565
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:31.529
art exposition in Germany or the Netherlands. I mean,

1566
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.490
I, I might be getting the date and the

1567
01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:36.350
place wrong, but it was in definitely in Europe

1568
01:34:36.359 --> 01:34:40.459
and definitely in the mid 2010. So uh uh

1569
01:34:40.490 --> 01:34:46.589
someone uh put uh a dog in an art

1570
01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:53.040
exposition. He was, he was tied to the by

1571
01:34:53.049 --> 01:34:57.240
a rope, I think to, to the wall and

1572
01:34:57.250 --> 01:35:01.299
then uh uh in front of him. But uh

1573
01:35:01.379 --> 01:35:05.959
Alpa is rich. They put their uh a plate

1574
01:35:05.970 --> 01:35:09.339
with food and the dog couldn't reach the food.

1575
01:35:09.609 --> 01:35:09.899
And

1576
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:12.750
I would, that would, that would infuriate me and

1577
01:35:12.759 --> 01:35:12.890
the,

1578
01:35:12.899 --> 01:35:18.890
and the, and the dog dive of starvation in

1579
01:35:18.899 --> 01:35:23.879
an art exposition. And when, when I, and, and,

1580
01:35:23.890 --> 01:35:27.290
and, and I, I mean, I didn't see that

1581
01:35:27.299 --> 01:35:33.850
directly. Fortunately, but when I got across that news,

1582
01:35:34.339 --> 01:35:40.890
I was like, man, whoever did this? I don't,

1583
01:35:40.899 --> 01:35:45.819
I don't care about abstract. I don't care about

1584
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:52.240
abstract well sounding artistic liberty. That's just play

1585
01:35:52.410 --> 01:35:55.149
cruelty, cruelty.

1586
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:58.779
I mean, you don't do and I,

1587
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:59.899
I, you're right.

1588
01:36:00.029 --> 01:36:03.950
You don't do that to a living being full

1589
01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:06.919
stop it. I just stands there. I don't care

1590
01:36:06.930 --> 01:36:12.770
about artistic liberty and those well sounding abstract words,

1591
01:36:12.779 --> 01:36:13.649
I don't care about that.

1592
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:18.160
I've never heard of that. And I'm, that's disgusting.

1593
01:36:18.419 --> 01:36:20.959
I just don't even, I don't even understand. I

1594
01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:23.229
don't think that's an artist. I think that's a

1595
01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.669
sadist who is pretending to be an artist. I

1596
01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:29.799
think that that's a very disturbed person because artists,

1597
01:36:29.879 --> 01:36:36.339
artists understand the difference between their work and you

1598
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:38.370
know what I mean? They understand that it's pretend

1599
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:42.870
and that they're, they're, they're reflecting parts of the

1600
01:36:42.879 --> 01:36:48.490
world around them and parts of their imagination. Um,

1601
01:36:50.459 --> 01:36:55.490
BUT that's, that doesn't make any sense to me.

1602
01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.540
I think that that artist was a sadist who

1603
01:36:57.549 --> 01:36:59.839
was masquerading as an artist. I don't think that's,

1604
01:36:59.850 --> 01:37:03.890
I don't, I, I don't even, I, I can't

1605
01:37:03.899 --> 01:37:05.069
even wrap my head around. I

1606
01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:09.669
know, look, there, there are, there are troubling stuff

1607
01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:15.020
in artistic creation but that one II, I mean,

1608
01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:20.140
that, that, that, that went beyond all limits for

1609
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:24.149
me. That, that was just probably the worst thing

1610
01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:28.220
I ever heard an artist doing. Uh

1611
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:35.359
Yes, I agree. I think, um I can't think

1612
01:37:35.370 --> 01:37:37.200
of anything in specific but I think that there,

1613
01:37:37.209 --> 01:37:39.370
that there have been times when I've been reading

1614
01:37:39.379 --> 01:37:43.520
something and I have felt uncomfortable because I feel

1615
01:37:43.529 --> 01:37:50.129
like the artist is either describing something that they've

1616
01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:55.850
done or want to do that is abhorrent. And

1617
01:37:56.109 --> 01:37:58.990
I can't say what makes me think that they're

1618
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.720
not just that it's not just in service of

1619
01:38:01.729 --> 01:38:04.419
the story. I, I'm not really sure what it

1620
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:07.859
is specifically that made me feel that except that

1621
01:38:07.959 --> 01:38:10.109
it's, it, it's similar to when you just get

1622
01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:12.049
a bad feeling about a person that you meet

1623
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.750
and you just think, I don't, I don't like

1624
01:38:13.759 --> 01:38:17.310
that person. There's something about them and, you know,

1625
01:38:17.319 --> 01:38:22.279
we just had a very, you know, perfunctory conversation.

1626
01:38:22.290 --> 01:38:26.020
It's, there's nothing that I can point to specifically,

1627
01:38:26.029 --> 01:38:28.459
but I don't have a uh I don't have

1628
01:38:28.479 --> 01:38:30.899
a positive feeling about this person.

1629
01:38:30.910 --> 01:38:34.689
And, you know, I, I mentioned that example, that

1630
01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:38.939
example specifically because in that example, there's no doubt

1631
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:42.080
that the guy who did that is an awful

1632
01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:45.310
but, but, but I mentioned

1633
01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:49.370
something, there's something very sick.

1634
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:53.450
Yeah. But, but that's the point I wanted to

1635
01:38:53.459 --> 01:39:01.439
get at because sometimes I find myself suspecting if

1636
01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:10.439
there are particular kinds of creators, artists that, uh,

1637
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:19.399
include certain things in their stories because they, uh,

1638
01:39:19.410 --> 01:39:24.560
uh, not because they just want to artistically explore

1639
01:39:24.569 --> 01:39:28.560
this or that, or create some sort of emotional

1640
01:39:28.569 --> 01:39:33.370
reaction but because they are actually sick in their

1641
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:37.859
heads, I think, yes, I think for sure in

1642
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:40.169
the same way that I think that there are,

1643
01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:43.759
you know, people go into certain professions that are

1644
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:47.640
honorable professions but they go into those professions because

1645
01:39:47.649 --> 01:39:52.000
it allows them under, you know, the guise of,

1646
01:39:52.009 --> 01:39:55.729
of either, um, you know, working with Children or

1647
01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:59.089
being in law enforcement to act out certain fantasies

1648
01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.830
of theirs that are not so healthy. You know,

1649
01:40:01.839 --> 01:40:04.029
I, I, that's something that we always have to

1650
01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:11.720
be careful of when, um, you know, allowing people

1651
01:40:12.509 --> 01:40:18.040
to be a, in situations where others are vulnerable.

1652
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:22.379
Mhm. Yeah. A and look, just to be clear,

1653
01:40:22.589 --> 01:40:27.299
I'm not saying at all at all that, all

1654
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:31.129
artists are the mature, all artists are, are bad

1655
01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:34.890
people. I mean, one thing that at least I

1656
01:40:34.899 --> 01:40:39.140
learned in life and uh I haven't seen any

1657
01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:44.000
evidence that goes against it is that most people

1658
01:40:44.009 --> 01:40:48.270
are decent people. And that means that sometimes they

1659
01:40:48.279 --> 01:40:51.810
make mistakes, sometimes they do bad, bad things that,

1660
01:40:51.819 --> 01:40:55.040
but most of the time they're just going on

1661
01:40:55.049 --> 01:40:57.779
with their normal lives, they work, they have their

1662
01:40:57.790 --> 01:41:01.100
families, they do their things they try to do

1663
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:04.910
as well as they can find. And then there

1664
01:41:04.919 --> 01:41:09.790
are a tiny minority of exceptionally good people and

1665
01:41:09.799 --> 01:41:11.759
then they are, there are also a t mi

1666
01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:17.060
uh, there's also a tiny minority of monsters and,

1667
01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:20.660
and, and, and, and, and, and that's also the

1668
01:41:20.669 --> 01:41:26.120
tiny minority of artists po possibly that I am

1669
01:41:26.129 --> 01:41:29.359
referring to here. So it's just that, that I'm

1670
01:41:29.370 --> 01:41:30.310
saying, I think

1671
01:41:30.319 --> 01:41:32.580
you're quite right and I, to me the evidence

1672
01:41:32.589 --> 01:41:34.919
for, for the fact that most people are, are

1673
01:41:34.930 --> 01:41:40.529
basically good under most circumstances, you know, particularly if

1674
01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:43.979
they're well socialized and if they're living within a,

1675
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:50.669
a healthy enough society with uh, appropriate rules and

1676
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:56.609
appropriate, um, punishments and, and, and, um, incentives. But

1677
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:59.100
if, if that weren't the case, we'd all be

1678
01:41:59.109 --> 01:42:01.470
in pretty big trouble, you know, every time we

1679
01:42:01.479 --> 01:42:03.240
left our house, you know, it would be like,

1680
01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:06.109
like the movie the purge, right that my kids

1681
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.850
have seen. Um, SO I, I think you're absolutely

1682
01:42:09.859 --> 01:42:12.709
right. I think though too, that, that tiny minority

1683
01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:15.120
can cause a lot of trouble, the tiny minority

1684
01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:16.799
of monsters. I mean, we can see that on

1685
01:42:16.810 --> 01:42:19.160
social media first. I mean, I think that there

1686
01:42:19.169 --> 01:42:22.450
are a lot of bots on social media. Um,

1687
01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:25.600
AND, well, that's, I guess an example of that

1688
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:27.729
because here's somebody who's got a bot farm who

1689
01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:34.870
has, well, the worst intentions and are, you know,

1690
01:42:34.919 --> 01:42:41.959
dive bombing people's posts and saying absolutely horrible things,

1691
01:42:41.970 --> 01:42:44.950
anything from just, you know, things that are uh

1692
01:42:44.959 --> 01:42:50.160
abhorrent, just morally abhorrent to um racist or, you

1693
01:42:50.169 --> 01:42:52.770
know, whatever it is just to, to kind of

1694
01:42:52.779 --> 01:42:56.370
create the illusion that there are more people who

1695
01:42:56.379 --> 01:42:58.890
feel that way than, than there really are. So

1696
01:42:58.899 --> 01:43:01.589
that maybe they can feel less alone in their

1697
01:43:01.620 --> 01:43:08.959
depravity. I think that that is, you know, part

1698
01:43:08.970 --> 01:43:11.140
of the way that, um you know, a, a

1699
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:17.470
platform like, like Twitter. Um BUT it's not just

1700
01:43:17.479 --> 01:43:18.669
Twitter. I mean, I don't mean to pick on

1701
01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:20.680
Twitter because I actually, I like Twitter. I use

1702
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:23.390
Twitter, I use a lot of social media platforms

1703
01:43:23.399 --> 01:43:24.680
and I think that they can be a force

1704
01:43:24.689 --> 01:43:26.229
for a lot of good, but they can also

1705
01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:28.879
be this weird sort of fun house mirror. It's

1706
01:43:28.890 --> 01:43:31.830
funny, I saw this interesting, I, I passed this

1707
01:43:31.839 --> 01:43:34.890
interesting post the other day and I wish I

1708
01:43:34.899 --> 01:43:36.910
had saved it, but I think I can recall

1709
01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:41.529
it but they uh the, the post basically described

1710
01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:47.399
how certain social media platforms, um kind of cater

1711
01:43:47.410 --> 01:43:51.220
to a certain one of the seven deadly sins.

1712
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:54.629
You know, Instagram is vanity. Uh I, I saw

1713
01:43:54.649 --> 01:43:59.490
that Twitter is wrath, right? Um, BUT I, I,

1714
01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:03.169
you know, Linkedin is Facebook is envy but I

1715
01:44:03.259 --> 01:44:04.799
tt is L

1716
01:44:05.799 --> 01:44:09.160
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I, I thought that was really

1717
01:44:09.169 --> 01:44:13.899
smart because, um, you know, at their, at their

1718
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:16.089
worst and this is, this is what's so hard.

1719
01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:17.810
I was talking to another friend of mine. She

1720
01:44:17.819 --> 01:44:21.459
had, you know, been, she had built out a

1721
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:26.640
lot of um the Amazon's advertising console, you know,

1722
01:44:26.649 --> 01:44:31.899
system. Um YOU know, she, she worked in that

1723
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:34.689
and as a result she uh you know, had,

1724
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:37.089
had been to conferences and such where there were

1725
01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:43.569
people who were dealing with um you know, they

1726
01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:46.250
were iii I wouldn't say they were content moderators

1727
01:44:46.259 --> 01:44:49.529
but they had some sort of function within these

1728
01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:52.709
uh social media companies that, that had to, you

1729
01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:58.990
know, monitor bots and all of this. And she

1730
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:02.410
was saying how just like God, I, I would

1731
01:45:02.419 --> 01:45:03.959
not want that job for anything else in the

1732
01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:05.959
world because it's so hard and you can't even

1733
01:45:05.970 --> 01:45:11.060
imagine all the crazy stuff that is happening. And

1734
01:45:11.069 --> 01:45:15.549
um you know, the bot farms and the, you

1735
01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:18.660
know, people who are, who are purposely, people and

1736
01:45:18.669 --> 01:45:23.339
entities who are, you know, purposely trying to um

1737
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:28.589
mhm you know, change a narrative or, or make

1738
01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:31.759
us see ourselves or see the world in, in

1739
01:45:31.770 --> 01:45:34.200
this sort of fun house mirror way and, and

1740
01:45:34.209 --> 01:45:38.560
how do you manage that? How do you, um,

1741
01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:42.930
how do you get rid of the bots while

1742
01:45:42.939 --> 01:45:48.459
still allowing people to speak and allowing that free

1743
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:51.410
flow of ideas to continue? It's very hard.

1744
01:45:53.279 --> 01:45:57.569
Yep. Yeah. But, but I mean, I just brought

1745
01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:05.330
this uh, discussion to the table about perhaps the

1746
01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:13.129
morality or immorality of certain, um, art pieces or

1747
01:46:13.140 --> 01:46:19.779
certain artists and, and perhaps uh possible the ontology

1748
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:24.790
for artists or something like that because uh I

1749
01:46:24.799 --> 01:46:26.959
mean, I, I don't know, e even I myself

1750
01:46:26.970 --> 01:46:31.270
do not have any definitive answers to these questions.

1751
01:46:31.279 --> 01:46:34.125
And uh and I, and I myself am not

1752
01:46:34.134 --> 01:46:36.975
so sure even when it comes to that list,

1753
01:46:36.984 --> 01:46:39.845
I've mentioned of films, I don't recommend to anyone

1754
01:46:39.854 --> 01:46:44.205
if I should really not recommend them or I'm

1755
01:46:44.214 --> 01:46:48.004
still sort of thinking about it. And that's why

1756
01:46:48.015 --> 01:46:51.024
sometimes I bring that to the table when talking

1757
01:46:51.035 --> 01:46:53.404
with certain people to see if I can uh

1758
01:46:53.415 --> 01:46:58.205
figure out my own thought process. But uh I

1759
01:46:58.214 --> 01:47:02.845
mean, it's just questions that I think are worth

1760
01:47:03.410 --> 01:47:08.430
uh exploring because there are perhaps certain things that

1761
01:47:08.439 --> 01:47:16.680
perhaps we give artists too much leeway. Uh And,

1762
01:47:16.750 --> 01:47:21.020
and because they are artists, perhaps there are too

1763
01:47:21.029 --> 01:47:25.350
many things that we excuse and perhaps some of

1764
01:47:25.359 --> 01:47:28.870
them we shouldn't. I'm not sure.

1765
01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:33.319
Yeah, I'm not sure. II I tend to think

1766
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:37.770
that when someone goes too far as the artist

1767
01:47:37.779 --> 01:47:42.640
with the dog did that, the way that we

1768
01:47:42.649 --> 01:47:51.479
tend to um counter that is with a society

1769
01:47:51.490 --> 01:47:54.649
healthy enough to condemn it and not reward it.

1770
01:47:56.220 --> 01:48:02.549
And that's, I think something that we really need

1771
01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:08.259
to be careful about in terms of um you

1772
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:12.850
know, how, how we structure our lives, how we

1773
01:48:12.859 --> 01:48:17.750
structure our cultures and our societies and understanding um

1774
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:25.240
when bad behaviors cannot be tolerated and must be,

1775
01:48:25.299 --> 01:48:33.279
um, must be not just openly discouraged but really

1776
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:37.910
deterred in, in a way that, that benefits the

1777
01:48:37.919 --> 01:48:42.419
whole, right? But not in a way that, um,

1778
01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:58.350
iii, I guess causes of, of this feels unfair

1779
01:48:58.359 --> 01:49:00.759
and causes a reaction, you know, a, a counter

1780
01:49:00.859 --> 01:49:04.359
reaction. But it's, it's, it's hard. I mean, I,

1781
01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:08.240
I am not a moral relativist, you know, and

1782
01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:10.750
I think that the moral relativism that has kind

1783
01:49:10.759 --> 01:49:17.990
of gripped, um, that, that's, that we're in the

1784
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.520
grips of, and that we have been in the

1785
01:49:19.529 --> 01:49:22.500
grips of for a few decades is not healthy.

1786
01:49:22.509 --> 01:49:25.839
I think that we have an obligation to ourselves

1787
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:29.089
and to society at large and certainly to the

1788
01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:32.259
most vulnerable to make a decision as to what

1789
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:34.729
is morally acceptable behavior and what isn't.

1790
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:38.509
Yeah. And, and you know, and if we don't,

1791
01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:41.680
we put, we put people in danger, usually people

1792
01:49:41.689 --> 01:49:43.620
who are most vulnerable people who are poor people

1793
01:49:43.629 --> 01:49:46.879
who are, you know, Children who, you know, cannot

1794
01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:51.049
care for themselves and make decisions for themselves and

1795
01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.839
that, um, we have to have the strength to

1796
01:49:54.850 --> 01:49:59.470
stand up for, you know, what, what's, what is

1797
01:49:59.479 --> 01:50:05.390
the best thing to do even if, uh, it

1798
01:50:05.399 --> 01:50:06.580
can be harsh sometimes.

1799
01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.459
Yeah. No, I know. And, you know, another thing

1800
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:12.180
that I find interesting here, at least for me

1801
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:16.080
is that, um, I tend to fall much more

1802
01:50:16.089 --> 01:50:19.180
on the liberal side of the aisle when it

1803
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:22.299
comes to politics, economics and all of that. But

1804
01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:28.160
when it comes to this particular artistic, moral questions

1805
01:50:28.169 --> 01:50:31.689
curiously enough, I, I guess that all of the

1806
01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:34.189
things I brought to the table here would be

1807
01:50:34.359 --> 01:50:39.290
the things that you usually associate with conservatives as

1808
01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:42.589
them, for example, saying that, oh, you shouldn't pick

1809
01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.419
that kind of thing in art and where, uh,

1810
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:48.379
I mean, that, that sort of thing. But yeah,

1811
01:50:48.439 --> 01:50:51.180
it, it is what it is so. Well, we

1812
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:57.339
need both. I mean, really we need, um, without

1813
01:50:57.350 --> 01:51:01.819
conservatives, uh, people who are more liberal and progressive

1814
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:06.740
would take us off a cliff and without liberals

1815
01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:11.589
and progressives, conservatives wouldn't allow our society to grow

1816
01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:15.990
because too cautious, we need both to work together.

1817
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.799
And I, I don't, I don't, I don't think

1818
01:51:18.810 --> 01:51:22.669
it would be healthy to be, um, someone who

1819
01:51:24.259 --> 01:51:27.209
only has a progressive mindset or only has a

1820
01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:30.859
conservative mindset. I think that, um, you know, part

1821
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:33.040
of the culture war that we're having is the

1822
01:51:33.049 --> 01:51:36.140
result of these two extremes which often sound very

1823
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:41.430
similar to one another. Um, HAVING arguments over the

1824
01:51:41.439 --> 01:51:45.740
vast majority of people who tend to pick and

1825
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:52.200
choose their, um, their, their, well, their viewpoints, I

1826
01:51:52.209 --> 01:51:55.470
guess a little, a little more, um, bipartisanly, let's

1827
01:51:55.479 --> 01:51:57.009
put it that way. You know what I mean?

1828
01:51:57.020 --> 01:51:59.430
And you can be a very liberal person and

1829
01:51:59.439 --> 01:52:04.790
yet think, ok, I think that there are moral

1830
01:52:04.799 --> 01:52:08.850
limits to what, uh, say a performance artist like

1831
01:52:08.859 --> 01:52:11.020
the artist you mentioned should be able to do

1832
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:12.899
that. No one should be able to come to

1833
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:16.979
harm or no creature. Um No sentient creature like

1834
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:18.379
a dog, you should be able to come to

1835
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:21.470
harm because in the name of quote art, right?

1836
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:24.950
I don't, I think that that is reasonable to

1837
01:52:24.959 --> 01:52:28.160
have that point of view and um just as

1838
01:52:28.169 --> 01:52:31.450
it's reasonable to be, you know, a conservative person

1839
01:52:31.459 --> 01:52:34.640
and, and say, I, I just, you know, don't,

1840
01:52:34.649 --> 01:52:38.529
don't have a problem with uh finding a compromise

1841
01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:44.649
on even an incredibly contentious uh societal issue like,

1842
01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:51.589
um like abortion or, or marriage rights or what,

1843
01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.479
whatever it is that that might be there, you

1844
01:52:53.490 --> 01:52:55.049
know, and I think most people are willing to

1845
01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:58.430
make compromises in between and most people understand that

1846
01:52:58.439 --> 01:53:02.490
there are pros and cons to, to most issues

1847
01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:05.549
and that we have to weigh those as, as,

1848
01:53:05.839 --> 01:53:07.990
as a society. And if we're, if we're not

1849
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.390
weighing them and we're only kind of marching lockstep

1850
01:53:11.549 --> 01:53:15.790
with um whatever side we believe ourselves to be

1851
01:53:15.799 --> 01:53:19.419
on that, that doesn't really feel like progress either.

1852
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:24.229
And that doesn't feel like, um, like it will

1853
01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:28.299
lead to a, a graceful and functioning society.

1854
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:31.549
Well, actually, now that I think about it and

1855
01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:36.229
um referring to the, that example with the dog,

1856
01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:38.490
I think, I, I don't know exactly when that

1857
01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:43.140
started. But uh uh uh uh don't you see

1858
01:53:43.149 --> 01:53:47.270
now when many times in movies before the movie

1859
01:53:47.279 --> 01:53:51.459
starts, uh, when they evolve animals a message there,

1860
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:57.479
something like no animals were, were hurt in the

1861
01:53:57.490 --> 01:54:00.430
filming of this movie or something like that. So

1862
01:54:00.439 --> 01:54:05.669
at least that's something that, uh, people care more

1863
01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:12.299
about and think that it goes beyond, uh, artistic

1864
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:14.439
expression, I guess. Yeah, I

1865
01:54:14.450 --> 01:54:17.609
think, I think most people are, are horrified by

1866
01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:20.270
that. I mean, really, I mean, isn't that, that

1867
01:54:20.279 --> 01:54:23.290
the, the one of the signs of, of a

1868
01:54:23.299 --> 01:54:27.899
future serial killer, someone who tortures animals as a

1869
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:30.180
kid? You know, I think that that is a

1870
01:54:30.189 --> 01:54:37.109
pretty serious taboo. Um, AND rightly so, uh, of,

1871
01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:41.390
you know, for one's own gratification to be hurting

1872
01:54:41.399 --> 01:54:44.430
another being, you know, that's, that's something that even,

1873
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.490
you know, even with like, talking about 50 shades

1874
01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:48.790
of gray that there's a reason why in those,

1875
01:54:48.799 --> 01:54:53.009
in, in those, um, communities there are all sorts

1876
01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:57.169
of strictures that are put into place so that,

1877
01:54:57.229 --> 01:55:01.810
um, you never go too far because of how

1878
01:55:01.819 --> 01:55:07.049
dangerous it is. Um, WHEN we do go too

1879
01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:17.140
far. Yeah, it is dangerous. You know, I think

1880
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.430
that.

1881
01:55:18.029 --> 01:55:21.839
