00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:02.960
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.739
Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo Lobs. And today I'm

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.069
joined by Dr Mauro Silva Junior. He is professor

4
00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.119
in the Department of Basic Psychological Processes at the

5
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.318
Psychology Institute at the University of Brasilia in Brazil.

6
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.450
He works on interpersonal relationships, especially the traits of

7
00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:24.666
individuals and their social partners such as sex differences,

8
00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:27.625
differences between parents and friends and the use of

9
00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:32.026
technology as a mediator of social interactions. And today,

10
00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:36.726
we're focusing mostly on interpersonal relationships from an evolutionary

11
00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:42.731
perspective, things like personality, sexual orientation. So, socio sexuality

12
00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:46.021
and the role some of those factors play in

13
00:00:46.032 --> 00:00:51.512
interpersonal relationships, namely in those particular cases, romantic relationships

14
00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:54.762
and also a little bit on mating systems in

15
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:58.442
human societies also from an evolutionary perspective. So, uh

16
00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:00.951
Maru, welcome to the show, it's a big pleasure

17
00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:01.532
to everyone.

18
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.138
It's my pleasure, Ricardo, thanks for the invitation.

19
00:01:06.089 --> 00:01:10.720
So uh to start with interpersonal relationships, there are,

20
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.650
of course, in humans, there's different kinds of interpersonal

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.279
relationships, like for example, relationships between parents and their

22
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.790
offspring, uh uh friendships, romantic relationships. So uh let's

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.254
start perhaps with the general intro action here and

24
00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:32.625
then we, we might tackle each specific kind of

25
00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:37.514
interpersonal relationship in turn here. So what aspects of

26
00:01:37.525 --> 00:01:42.584
human cognition and motivation would you say play the

27
00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:48.004
biggest role in interpersonal relationships from an evolutionary perspective?

28
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.190
Um OK. Yes, I would say that there are

29
00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:56.319
a lot of uh different aspects of our cognition,

30
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.970
motivation that play a role in our interpersonal relationships.

31
00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.209
I think you and your public may be familiar

32
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.910
with the cheated detection system and the keen detection

33
00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:14.360
system, they comprise what we call cognition. Uh But

34
00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.600
from an evolutionary perspective, I think it doesn't make

35
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.100
much sense to the to separate cognition and motivation.

36
00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:28.500
Uh For example, if, if one individual uh learn

37
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:33.610
cues to detect cues, to learn who their king

38
00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:37.479
are, this individual is also more likely to trade

39
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.820
off his or her own welfare to provide benefits

40
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.889
to their king. So this is also motivation, right?

41
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.919
Uh I see that most of the time the

42
00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:53.970
cognition, motivation work together to regulate behavior. So I

43
00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.289
think this is the the right way to approach

44
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.289
this. And I think this difference is more didactic,

45
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.899
it makes sense in this Didac sense, but uh

46
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.669
usually they work together. Uh But from the motivational

47
00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:14.880
aspect, I would say that um that is the

48
00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:21.559
search and maintaining for romantic and sexual uh relationships

49
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.270
and also to develop friendships. Uh It's interesting um

50
00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.029
the fact uh of studying the interpersonal relationships from

51
00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:36.460
the evolutionary perspective is that uh it challenges an

52
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.720
old idea that uh studying the evolution of our

53
00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.300
behavior. It kind of lead us to an understand

54
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:49.139
of an individualistic perspective, the of humans. But this

55
00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:52.539
is far from true as more as I study

56
00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.460
the interpersonal relationships, more II I came to the

57
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.449
conclusion that from the the cognition perspective or the

58
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.250
motivational perspective, how social we are, how dependent of

59
00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:06.059
all those we are. And this is can be

60
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.539
uh very um it's very clear in, in, in,

61
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.020
in studies from uh the evolutionary perspective. Uh I

62
00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:21.010
think for example, the the revised uh parameter of

63
00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.940
needs from an evolutionary perspective as a powerful framework

64
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.410
to understand how our motivational systems are related to

65
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.149
sociality. And that's why I, I do it with

66
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.950
a great pleasure.

67
00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:41.670
Mhm And so let's get specifically now into relationships

68
00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:46.970
with parents. So what aspects again of our human

69
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.950
psychology play the biggest role here? I mean, what

70
00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:53.839
aspects of our human psychology do you think are

71
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.410
more important for people to have a good understanding

72
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.130
of, to understand how relationships with parents work from

73
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:05.609
an evolutionary perspective?

74
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.880
Uh Well, I would say there are a lot

75
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.760
of them, but for example, um I, I would

76
00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:18.140
say that paternity, uncertainty play an important role. Uh

77
00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:21.649
I have data from this on my uh phd

78
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.869
dissertation. Uh WHEN I studied the interpersonal relationships, not

79
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.380
only with parents but with the relatives in general.

80
00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:35.130
Um I used the social networks questionnaire that was

81
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.709
developed by Robin do and apply this questionnaire in

82
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.369
Brazil. So in this questionnaire, we uh requested very

83
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:51.839
specific information about each uh of individuals, relatives, like

84
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.920
uh they have to describe the initials of their

85
00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:58.670
names, uh their age, their sex, if they were

86
00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:02.959
maternal or paternal, if they were genetic or adoptive

87
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.809
relatives, the emotional closes that, that people uh felt

88
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.070
towards them and uh how far they lived from

89
00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:16.600
each other. Uh One interesting result about this study

90
00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:20.929
was our discovery that people describe it more maternal

91
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.950
relatives than maternal relatives. And, and it's interesting because

92
00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:29.809
we collected data in Brazil uh in England and

93
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.369
in Belgium. But it, it's very unlikely right, that

94
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.720
people in three different countries have more maternal relatives

95
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.140
than maternal relatives. Uh But there is a, there

96
00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:44.450
is an uh uh an answer for that. Um

97
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.010
For example, we we ask people to use their

98
00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:54.799
mobile agenda to fulfill the questionnaires. And if, if

99
00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:58.059
they have used the mobile agenda, they could not

100
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.799
forget anyone but uh in, in fulfilling the questionnaires,

101
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.420
we also would see an alphabetic order. For example,

102
00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:09.220
the first people to be described, it would be

103
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.779
for example, Alice and then Brandon and, and in,

104
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.109
in the late sections, it would be Gad but

105
00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:19.959
Mauru before he can, but we don't see an

106
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.179
alphabet code in the in any of these questionnaires.

107
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.170
Uh What people did. Uh THEY, they, they, they

108
00:07:28.179 --> 00:07:32.649
have a logic on describing those relationships but they

109
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.079
didn't use the the mobile agenda actually. Uh WHEN

110
00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:40.329
you see the first rank position, the first line

111
00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:44.420
of the questionnaire. Uh IT'S in most of cases,

112
00:07:44.429 --> 00:07:49.660
most more than 76% of the time, I think

113
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.279
it was their mothers. Usually the mothers is the

114
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:56.630
first line. The first person they describe the first

115
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.470
rank position. The questionnaire, the second rank position is

116
00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:05.100
uh in most of cases their fathers in and

117
00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:07.739
in the first, in the third ranked position, their

118
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.429
siblings. And from this point on, they start to

119
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.220
describe all the kinds of relatives from the maternal

120
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.070
side of the family and the paternal side of

121
00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:20.540
the family uh in this parent is, is found

122
00:08:20.549 --> 00:08:24.209
in all three countries. Uh BUT the way they

123
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.369
decided to describe their relationships is uh give us

124
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.350
a clue why they have, they describe it more

125
00:08:31.359 --> 00:08:35.140
maternal than maternal relatives. It's because there is uh

126
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.469
an association between the rank position and and the

127
00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.979
emotional closes, they feel towards each of those, those

128
00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:47.989
people, for example, their mother, that was usually the

129
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.929
first person they described, they have, they have they

130
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.140
had the the highest emotional close in this level.

131
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.609
And when you go to the second, the 3rd

132
00:08:58.619 --> 00:09:01.570
and 4th ranked positions, there is a decrease of

133
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.429
the emotional close in this level. So uh I

134
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.710
don't believe the participants were aware they were doing

135
00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:13.010
this, but there is a logic on, on doing

136
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.789
this once they didn't, they didn't uh use the

137
00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:21.020
the mobile agenda, they had to uh use a

138
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.390
different logic and they use the emotional closeness level.

139
00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:29.000
So we we actually found a negative correlation between

140
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:34.179
rank position and emotional closeness level. The the highest

141
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.690
of the emotional close closes, uh closes level is

142
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.909
associated with the lower rank positions. And even more

143
00:09:42.919 --> 00:09:46.210
interesting than that is the fact that with the

144
00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:51.849
Matano uh relatives in all three countries, people had

145
00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:55.580
the highest emotional closeness level when compared to the

146
00:09:55.929 --> 00:10:00.830
maternal ones. Um And I think this is interesting

147
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.409
because for example, we have three countries, two in

148
00:10:04.419 --> 00:10:08.250
Europe and one in South America. Uh WE can

149
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.340
say the, the three of them are, they belong

150
00:10:11.349 --> 00:10:17.270
to the Western, the western cultures. But uh we,

151
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.419
we cannot say that we can't say they are

152
00:10:20.429 --> 00:10:24.469
the same, there are similarities among them, but there

153
00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:28.200
are also a cultural differences among them, even if

154
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.969
we consider the England and Belgium, uh this kind

155
00:10:32.979 --> 00:10:37.929
of relationship that is more uh proximate with maternal

156
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.890
relatives seems to be the case of Western cultures,

157
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.460
for example, uh in traditional societies where there is

158
00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:50.330
a norm uh of uh patri local norm uh

159
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.260
where women, when they get married, they leave their

160
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.739
campsite and uh and go to to live with

161
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:04.239
the husband's family, uh their families uh make make

162
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:10.229
guarantees that they, they're getting married virgins. So when

163
00:11:10.239 --> 00:11:13.119
they, when they get married, they are not only

164
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:18.219
controlled by the vigilance of their own husbands. But

165
00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:23.580
also with the husband's family. And in these societies,

166
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.530
if you ask Children, uh from which grandparents or

167
00:11:28.539 --> 00:11:31.979
uncles and aunts, which of them, the maternal side

168
00:11:31.989 --> 00:11:34.539
of the paternal side, they like more. They would

169
00:11:34.549 --> 00:11:37.659
say the paternal side, they would choose their paternal

170
00:11:37.669 --> 00:11:42.530
grandparents, the paternal uncles, the paternal ones because it's

171
00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:45.390
among them that they are raised and they develop

172
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:49.340
more uh intimate relationships with them. But in the

173
00:11:49.349 --> 00:11:53.229
absence of a norm like this, people actually become

174
00:11:53.239 --> 00:11:56.539
more um close to the maternal side of the

175
00:11:56.549 --> 00:12:00.510
family. And we understand this uh through the lens

176
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.080
of the paternal uncertainty. So the paternity, uncertainty in

177
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.200
traditional societies make makes easier for Children to develop

178
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.159
strong relationship with the paternal side of the family.

179
00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:14.530
But in the absence of this uh in this

180
00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:20.739
cultural norm, people develop more uh uh close relationships

181
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.669
with the maternal side of the family because uh

182
00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:28.479
for instance, uh there is AAA 100% of certainty

183
00:12:28.489 --> 00:12:31.609
that the the maternal side of the family belongs

184
00:12:31.619 --> 00:12:32.599
to the same family.

185
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:37.849
Mhm No, that, that's very interesting. Actually, before you

186
00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:41.000
got to the last part of your answer, I

187
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:45.059
was really going to ask you about paternity, uncertainty

188
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.520
and if it really played a role there, but

189
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.440
you already answered that part. And so I guess

190
00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:53.250
that in that particular case with the study you

191
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.380
did there particularly, we could say that there are

192
00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.320
cultural factors playing a role here but also uh

193
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.539
aspects of our evolved psychology, psychology, like in that

194
00:13:06.549 --> 00:13:10.609
specific case, paternity, uncertainty that might also play a

195
00:13:10.619 --> 00:13:14.580
role, at least in the absence of those cultural

196
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.780
factors you pointed to like for example, uh patri

197
00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:19.789
locality. Correct.

198
00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:23.659
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. And, and I think that,

199
00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:26.599
that that must be the case because for example,

200
00:13:26.609 --> 00:13:29.909
if we, if we go back to the four

201
00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:34.130
questions of pathology, our behavior is better understood if

202
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.679
we know all the uh ultimate imp proximate uh

203
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.539
explanations of behavior. And I think in this case,

204
00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:46.969
we have an ultimate uh causation which is pater

205
00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:51.349
paternity, uncertainty and approximate causation, which is this patri

206
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.770
local law. Uh

207
00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:57.479
There you are referring to a tin burger t

208
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.330
burgers for questions, right.

209
00:14:00.979 --> 00:14:03.000
Yes. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

210
00:14:03.539 --> 00:14:08.409
So what about friendships then? So that, that's about

211
00:14:08.489 --> 00:14:13.489
uh what we talked here was about relationships between

212
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.010
parents and their offspring. And now what about friendships?

213
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.010
What aspects of our evolved psychology play a role

214
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.210
there?

215
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.109
Mhm. Uh I, I also can say there are

216
00:14:26.119 --> 00:14:29.500
many factors involved but one of one of those

217
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.080
factors that uh I think is one of the

218
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:38.169
most important ones is homophily, homophily is the, the

219
00:14:38.179 --> 00:14:42.590
level the degree of similarity between two people. Uh

220
00:14:42.599 --> 00:14:45.250
For example, if they share the same age, the

221
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:49.580
same sex or gender, uh if they have a

222
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:55.669
similar interests for sports, for music, if they, they

223
00:14:55.679 --> 00:15:00.080
share a similar traits of personality and homophobic is

224
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.510
the degree of uh similarity between them. There is

225
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.979
also a dream for homophily for couples, which is

226
00:15:07.989 --> 00:15:12.349
homo homo Gamey describes exactly the same thing. And

227
00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:14.909
we can understand Homo as a sort of mating

228
00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:19.530
that the level of similarity between, between couples. But

229
00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:22.169
uh coming back from France, uh I think that

230
00:15:22.179 --> 00:15:26.630
homophily is very powerful uh to understand this because

231
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.630
it really shapes how we uh interact with uh

232
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:34.109
other people. And I, I would, I would try

233
00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:39.070
to, to illustrate this case. Uh GIVE an example

234
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.729
of a game in Brazil. I don't know if

235
00:15:41.739 --> 00:15:43.919
you have a similar game in Portugal or in

236
00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:46.500
the countries of your audience. But there is a

237
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.409
game is a, is a uh a chair game

238
00:15:49.659 --> 00:15:53.869
where for example, we have five chairs but only

239
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.169
four players,

240
00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:58.679
we have the, we have the same game here.

241
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:03.130
Yeah. OK. OK. So that's interesting. Uh And the,

242
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.599
and the music is playing and the, and, and

243
00:16:05.609 --> 00:16:09.619
these four players are running around the chairs and

244
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.840
when the music stops, uh those players have to

245
00:16:12.849 --> 00:16:15.440
find a seat for themselves, but once there is

246
00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.219
only four chairs, um uh so one of one

247
00:16:20.229 --> 00:16:24.900
of the players will be left out. Uh And

248
00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:28.049
then the, the, the, the game starts another round.

249
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.979
And I, I think from, from a, from a

250
00:16:31.989 --> 00:16:37.130
developmental perspective, this is what happens uh in our,

251
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.510
in our relationships with friends. There are some people

252
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.609
that have a seat for example, uh for some

253
00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:47.530
time, but they might leave eventually for some reason.

254
00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.239
Uh Do I, I have data about this also

255
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.030
in, from my phd dissertation and I came to

256
00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:58.250
the conclusion he can, that we kind of have

257
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.650
uh we kind of manage our interpersonal relationships. And

258
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.489
WW what do exactly mean when I say manage,

259
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.459
uh I really need manage because there are more

260
00:17:12.469 --> 00:17:16.069
people in the world that we are able to

261
00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:20.300
form and maintain our relationship. That's the premise of

262
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.400
the dumbest number theory, right that you uh are

263
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.979
familiar with. So uh that is maybe that is

264
00:17:27.064 --> 00:17:31.324
the limitation, a cognitive limitation to manage those relationships.

265
00:17:31.525 --> 00:17:35.444
And we have to choose to pick, to pick

266
00:17:35.454 --> 00:17:39.805
people from the ground and use the degree of

267
00:17:39.814 --> 00:17:44.885
similarity between us and them to develop these friendships.

268
00:17:45.305 --> 00:17:48.125
For example, if two people that don't know each

269
00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:52.405
other uh uh in the in the first contact,

270
00:17:52.415 --> 00:17:56.479
they, they came to know that they have studied

271
00:17:56.489 --> 00:17:58.939
in the same school, for example, or in the

272
00:17:58.949 --> 00:18:06.380
same university, this information alone. Uh WE work as

273
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:11.270
uh increasing the, the, the, the likelihood of uh

274
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.979
a positive uh interaction. So they will feel more

275
00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:18.569
close to each other because they shared something. So

276
00:18:18.579 --> 00:18:20.709
that's why I think that we, we do not

277
00:18:20.719 --> 00:18:23.619
have, we, we do have an active role in

278
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:28.750
our uh uh relationships. Even even if we're not

279
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.130
aware of this, we of course, are not aware

280
00:18:31.609 --> 00:18:34.439
they were choosing people because of the sex, because

281
00:18:34.449 --> 00:18:37.219
of the gender. But we like more people who

282
00:18:37.229 --> 00:18:41.619
are similar to us. Even more recent studies about

283
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.410
politics, for example, show that we have more uh

284
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.430
interest with people who, with whom we share more

285
00:18:49.439 --> 00:18:53.770
similarities with, with whom we share more of our

286
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.790
political view and, and, and et cetera. So I

287
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.750
think homophile is a good candidate or to understand

288
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:05.640
how um our friendship is uh is uh can

289
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.979
be uh understood uh from this uh psychological perspective.

290
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:14.810
Mhm. And I mean, from an evolutionary perspective, would

291
00:19:14.819 --> 00:19:20.510
the rationale behind homophily be something like, uh we

292
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:24.300
tend to prefer to establish relationships with people that

293
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.719
are similar to us in our interests, goals and

294
00:19:28.729 --> 00:19:33.150
so on because uh they would help us achieve

295
00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.530
those same goals and uh interests. Is that it?

296
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.579
Yes. Yes, I believe, I believe, yes. Because for

297
00:19:41.589 --> 00:19:45.349
example, if people share the same interests, they might

298
00:19:45.359 --> 00:19:48.959
have the same agenda if, if you have uh

299
00:19:48.969 --> 00:19:53.619
a coalition of psychological perspective of, of this relationship,

300
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.609
if they, if people share the same interests, they

301
00:19:56.619 --> 00:20:00.119
might share uh the same agenda. Uh And when

302
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.989
I say agenda, I mean, this is general, not

303
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.540
only uh political ones but they, they, that could

304
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.109
be facil that could facilitate cooper operation for certain.

305
00:20:09.739 --> 00:20:14.560
Mhm. So let's get now into romantic partners then.

306
00:20:14.569 --> 00:20:17.439
And I guess that the rest of the interview

307
00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:20.819
will focus a lot on romantic relationships in different

308
00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:26.454
ways. So we've already tackled apparent offspring relations and

309
00:20:26.464 --> 00:20:31.785
friendships. What factors from an evolutionary perspective play the

310
00:20:31.795 --> 00:20:36.005
biggest role or some of the biggest factors here

311
00:20:36.015 --> 00:20:41.295
in romantic relationships or relationships between romantic partners.

312
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.199
Mhm. Um, I, I tend to focus on relationship

313
00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:53.680
satisfaction when I'm studying romantic relationships. Uh, BECAUSE from,

314
00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:59.439
uh, an evolutionary psychological perspective, relationship satisfaction is the

315
00:20:59.449 --> 00:21:04.089
subjective feeling that awaits the costs and benefits of

316
00:21:04.099 --> 00:21:08.569
the, of our relationships. So if the benefits outweigh

317
00:21:08.579 --> 00:21:12.020
the costs, people would feel more satisfied with their

318
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:16.219
relationships, for example. And there are a lot of

319
00:21:16.229 --> 00:21:20.699
uh all the variables that might influence people's uh

320
00:21:20.839 --> 00:21:25.839
relationship satisfaction. The 11 of those that I chose

321
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:30.719
to understand this was the a adult attachment theory.

322
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:35.979
Um And, and why is that many studies show

323
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:41.319
there is a positive correlation between uh a secure

324
00:21:41.329 --> 00:21:46.479
attachment and relationship satisfaction. But uh on the other

325
00:21:46.489 --> 00:21:48.969
hand, there is, there are also some studies that

326
00:21:48.979 --> 00:21:53.510
show there is no association between them or some,

327
00:21:53.599 --> 00:21:57.000
some studies that show that is uh a negative

328
00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.989
association between them that is uh uh an expected

329
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:09.229
um uh correlation between security and uh relationship satisfaction.

330
00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.430
So in, in a recent paper published last year,

331
00:22:13.439 --> 00:22:18.010
uh my students and I sought to investigate using

332
00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.329
a systematic review uh to understand this question if

333
00:22:23.339 --> 00:22:27.689
there is indeed the the relationship between security, secure

334
00:22:27.699 --> 00:22:32.810
attachment and satisfaction is positive. And we also try

335
00:22:32.819 --> 00:22:37.619
to taking into account the cultural differences that might

336
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:43.089
exist because uh the attachment theory was developed as

337
00:22:43.099 --> 00:22:46.510
most of the psychological theories was developed in western

338
00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:51.489
cultures. So it's interesting for not only interesting, but

339
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:56.180
it's important for an evolutionary perspective, take into account

340
00:22:56.189 --> 00:23:01.160
uh a cross cultural uh view. Uh So we,

341
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:04.650
at the end, I think we had 33 studies

342
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.910
from many parts of the world and the majority

343
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.250
of them, like 80% of them uh confirmed this

344
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:19.229
uh uh association. There is a positive association between

345
00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:25.030
secure attachment and relationship satisfaction or uh a negative

346
00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.709
association between insecure attachment and relationship satisfaction. Uh And

347
00:23:31.719 --> 00:23:35.510
this is also true for both Western countries and

348
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.709
non western countries like Malaysia like Iran for example.

349
00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:45.560
And uh but but there are some uh important

350
00:23:45.569 --> 00:23:50.790
uh differences among those, those countries too. For example,

351
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.949
we we also found that uh uh studies that

352
00:23:54.959 --> 00:23:58.819
found no association between the two constructs. And uh

353
00:23:58.849 --> 00:24:01.430
there are studies that also found that there is

354
00:24:01.439 --> 00:24:07.290
a negative association between secure attachment and uh relationship

355
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.900
satisfaction. And the majority of these results who do

356
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.479
not conform the general rule, they belong to non

357
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.439
western countries. To be, to be honest, I don't

358
00:24:18.449 --> 00:24:22.050
have an explanation for this. Uh What we know

359
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:28.680
is that in different countries, uh the predominant uh

360
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.819
attachment style might differ in some cases is the

361
00:24:32.829 --> 00:24:36.199
secure attachment. You know, the cases is the the

362
00:24:36.209 --> 00:24:41.339
avoidance uh attachment or the youngsters avoid. So they

363
00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:44.489
the, the, the, the, the predominant style might of

364
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.229
course interfere in this relationship. Uh, BUT in general,

365
00:24:49.239 --> 00:24:51.829
yes, I would say that, uh, the, the answer

366
00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:56.079
is that most of studies involve Western and Northwestern

367
00:24:56.089 --> 00:25:01.599
countries showed a positive association between security and satisfaction.

368
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.000
Mhm.

369
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.380
And of course, there's also other factors that could

370
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.310
play a role here and one of them is

371
00:25:11.319 --> 00:25:15.270
personality or personality traits. So, what is the role

372
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:21.410
played by personality in interpersonal uh relationships in general?

373
00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.800
Now, now I'm talking about interpersonal relationships in general,

374
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.579
not just romantic relationships.

375
00:25:28.569 --> 00:25:33.130
Uh OK. Uh Well, I would say that if

376
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.979
we take, for example, the big frame work, we

377
00:25:35.989 --> 00:25:39.660
can understand that uh we can see that uh

378
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:44.630
those personality traits influence our behavior in general. For

379
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.270
example, there are uh evidence that people who have

380
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.890
a certain type of relationship of, of personality. They,

381
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:55.180
they tend to be more uh extrovert or more

382
00:25:55.189 --> 00:26:01.410
introvert, for example. Um I'm, I'm actually uh more

383
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:06.339
interested in the doctor tried personality traits, for example,

384
00:26:06.349 --> 00:26:09.930
uh in most of the, in most of the,

385
00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:13.849
in the literature, uh there is evidence that this

386
00:26:13.859 --> 00:26:19.560
uh personality traits like Machiavellian is like psychopathy and

387
00:26:19.569 --> 00:26:24.300
narcissism. They play a role in social relationships because

388
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:30.760
these three traits share a common and social psychology

389
00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:35.939
that uh in a, in a way that individuals

390
00:26:35.949 --> 00:26:40.640
act in a certain way to uh provide benefits

391
00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:44.819
for themselves at the expansion of uh of other

392
00:26:44.829 --> 00:26:48.670
people. And there are a lot of studies showing

393
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.979
that, for example, that people are more people with

394
00:26:51.989 --> 00:26:55.979
higher levels of doctor traits. They, they tend to

395
00:26:55.989 --> 00:26:59.489
lie more, they tend to cheat or cheat, to

396
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.109
cheat on exams. More, they cheat on their partners

397
00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:08.260
more frequently than people who have, uh, uh, lower

398
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.880
levels of drug trade personality traits.

399
00:27:11.439 --> 00:27:14.540
Mhm. A and by the way, how do you

400
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.390
approach personality from an evolutionary perspective? I'm asking you

401
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.380
that because uh at least as far as I

402
00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:25.290
understand it. And through the conversations I had on

403
00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.689
the show with many evolutionary psychologists at this point,

404
00:27:28.959 --> 00:27:32.410
uh they are mostly interested or, or you are

405
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.859
mostly interested in understanding the aspects of our evolved

406
00:27:36.869 --> 00:27:42.290
psychology that are uh the theoretically, at least universal.

407
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:47.900
There is the, the common uh information processing mechanisms,

408
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.550
the the ones that are common across all societies,

409
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:56.310
all humans. But then there are personality traits that

410
00:27:56.319 --> 00:27:59.890
uh I mean, play a role in explaining uh

411
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.170
individual differences. I mean, they are one aspect of

412
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.030
our individual differences. So how do you approach personality

413
00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.579
from an evolutionary perspective?

414
00:28:12.849 --> 00:28:15.739
Uh OK. I I also tend to agree with

415
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:20.579
this. Uh But I think we will find uh

416
00:28:20.589 --> 00:28:25.969
this universal aspect of personality as many other uh

417
00:28:25.979 --> 00:28:31.189
psychological aspects such as emotion, cognition, motivation uh in

418
00:28:31.199 --> 00:28:34.359
the, in the relationship between the demands of the

419
00:28:34.369 --> 00:28:38.609
environment such as uh an adaptive problem and the,

420
00:28:38.959 --> 00:28:44.270
the supposed psychological process that is involved with the

421
00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.959
solution of this uh adaptive problem. And maybe that's

422
00:28:48.969 --> 00:28:52.959
why we can find this association between uh dark

423
00:28:52.969 --> 00:28:56.199
tribe traits and a social behavior because in some

424
00:28:56.209 --> 00:29:01.859
case, it's adaptive for people to benefit themselves even

425
00:29:01.869 --> 00:29:08.030
if it's expensive of other people. Um But II,

426
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.619
I will, I cannot say, for example, that it's

427
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:15.859
not the same to say that all people will,

428
00:29:15.869 --> 00:29:19.910
will present the same personality traits or they will

429
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.780
present the same level of these traits. And why

430
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:27.670
is that? Probably because they are exposed to different

431
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.849
uh envi environments. And in response to the challenge

432
00:29:32.859 --> 00:29:36.160
of those vitamins, they developed a certain level of

433
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:41.010
personality traits. So they could be higher in psychopathy

434
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:45.410
and narcissism. But other people who are not exposed

435
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.729
to this kind of vitamins would uh develop uh

436
00:29:49.739 --> 00:29:53.310
all kinds of uh personality traits. That is that

437
00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:56.199
is an indication, for example, from life history theory

438
00:29:56.209 --> 00:30:01.449
that the dark tried traits uh may may be

439
00:30:01.459 --> 00:30:06.959
part of the f uh life history strategy. Um

440
00:30:07.719 --> 00:30:10.920
I, I have, I have a uh a chapter

441
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.689
on this but I I think this, this association

442
00:30:14.699 --> 00:30:17.680
between the dark tribe traits and the life, the

443
00:30:17.689 --> 00:30:20.959
life history. The the first life history structure is

444
00:30:20.969 --> 00:30:25.060
not as straightforward as has been a knowledge in

445
00:30:25.069 --> 00:30:30.170
the literature. There are some shortcomings that provide some

446
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.150
uh doubts that we should not uh consider uh

447
00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:40.369
the doctor tried personality uh so easily as part

448
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.469
of the first of life history. Mhm.

449
00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:47.030
Yeah. I, in that particular case, I mean, if

450
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.829
that would be true, then according to life history

451
00:30:50.839 --> 00:30:55.849
theory applied to humans in that. So if people

452
00:30:55.859 --> 00:31:02.050
are exposed to an environment where there's, uh, more

453
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.579
resource stress, I mean, they, they have, uh, fewer

454
00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:10.630
resources and stuff like that and fewer uh future

455
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.760
prospect, lower future prospects and stuff like that, then

456
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:19.510
they would tend to develop higher levels of the

457
00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.640
dark tri personality traits because those would be adaptive

458
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.430
in that kind of environment. Is that it?

459
00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:31.520
Yes, yes. But those studies also show that this

460
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:33.760
is true for some of the person from, from

461
00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:36.459
the doctor traits, but it's not true for the

462
00:31:36.469 --> 00:31:39.560
others. And in some cases, they go against into

463
00:31:39.569 --> 00:31:43.900
the hypothesis. And for example, uh a student of

464
00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:49.300
mine just presented her master's uh thesis and she

465
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:54.510
found that psychopathy was not in adolescence was not

466
00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:59.150
related to the level of severity or unpredictability in

467
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.280
their environments. So I think yes, that is an

468
00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:05.290
indication but it's not so strong. Mhm.

469
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.660
So let's talk a little bit now about the

470
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:14.079
evolution of sexual orientation. So how do you approach

471
00:32:14.089 --> 00:32:17.160
it uh from an evolutionary perspective?

472
00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.670
Uh Yeah, I think he got the, the it's

473
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:27.229
best to describe the devolution of same sex, sexual

474
00:32:27.239 --> 00:32:34.069
uh behavior. Uh BECAUSE the concept of sexual orientation

475
00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:39.609
is uh specific to humans and uh particularly from

476
00:32:39.619 --> 00:32:44.369
Western cultures, uh the, you know, western cultures, they

477
00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:47.920
don't, they they don't have this concept of sexual

478
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:53.219
orientation, for example, uh the fain is from Samoa,

479
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.199
which is a culture that has same sex, sexual

480
00:32:57.209 --> 00:32:59.969
behavior. And I'm sorry, I, I will, I will

481
00:32:59.979 --> 00:33:05.319
say only SSB to make it easier. Uh So

482
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:10.000
in, in the Samoa Islands that there is SSB

483
00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:14.060
but the we we, we find that in the

484
00:33:14.069 --> 00:33:19.069
pho pho fens are adult males who, who develop

485
00:33:19.079 --> 00:33:22.260
a sexual attraction to all the adult males, but

486
00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:26.459
they have uh another gender. So they, they, they

487
00:33:26.469 --> 00:33:30.439
dress in a different way and this third gender

488
00:33:30.459 --> 00:33:33.630
is recognized by the society. It's not the same

489
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.800
as being a woman. Uh The pines of Samoa,

490
00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:42.390
they do know that they exist the gay men

491
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.849
in the West, but they say they are not

492
00:33:44.859 --> 00:33:48.099
gay men. And when, when we, when it's asked

493
00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:51.680
them why they say that gay men have sex

494
00:33:51.689 --> 00:33:54.449
with other gay men while for a fe have

495
00:33:54.459 --> 00:33:59.119
sex with heterosexual men. So we can see in

496
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:03.040
here a difference between what is a sexual orientation?

497
00:34:03.369 --> 00:34:07.880
How it's, it is conceptualized in the West. And

498
00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:12.129
uh a question about gender, how it is conceptual,

499
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:17.030
conceptualized in the, in the islands of Samoa. So

500
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.350
what what that is in common between them, the

501
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.560
same sex, sexual behavior or the same sex uh

502
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:28.020
uh sexual attraction. So I would say it's better

503
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:33.389
to describe the, the, the SSB for example. And

504
00:34:33.399 --> 00:34:38.389
we can understand SSB also from a cross cultural

505
00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:43.599
perspective and, and a comparative perspective uh in the,

506
00:34:43.608 --> 00:34:47.888
in the evolution of SSB, for example, uh a

507
00:34:47.898 --> 00:34:52.829
lot of different hypotheses have been tested and some

508
00:34:52.839 --> 00:34:55.717
of them suggest that we might not have a

509
00:34:55.728 --> 00:35:03.350
single explanation for SSB in different animal species. Uh

510
00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:08.560
For instance, uh the inability to discriminate between males

511
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.590
and females might be the explanation why we find

512
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.510
SSB in fruit flies, for example. Uh On the

513
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.820
other hand, uh in species like dolphins, the better

514
00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:25.889
explanation for SSB will be uh learning the appropriate

515
00:35:25.899 --> 00:35:30.580
sexual behavior to present with an individual of a

516
00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:35.010
different sex. But none of this hypothesis can be

517
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.000
applied to humans. And for the reason that I

518
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.250
uh I already mentioned it and that, that there

519
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:46.189
is more, more uh things in, in, in on

520
00:35:46.199 --> 00:35:49.780
the table about tho those hypothesis. And I would

521
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:53.189
say, for example, that in the past uh uh

522
00:35:53.199 --> 00:35:57.679
same sex sexual behavior was considered a Renan paradox.

523
00:35:58.419 --> 00:36:03.020
And researchers tend to think that way because they

524
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:07.729
worked on the assumption that SSB would not benefit

525
00:36:07.739 --> 00:36:11.520
uh the, the fitness of the individuals who present

526
00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:15.350
this behavior. But from the recent decades, there are

527
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.120
more and more evidence showing quite the opposite that

528
00:36:19.129 --> 00:36:25.820
the, the SSB actually increases uh if not directly

529
00:36:25.889 --> 00:36:30.139
but indirectly the, the the fitness of the individuals

530
00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:31.540
who present this behavior.

531
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:36.340
Mhm And so in that particular case, the hypothesis

532
00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:40.110
that you're working with there is the one where,

533
00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:45.330
for example, there would be an increase in fitness

534
00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:50.719
for the individual himself because, uh, they would, uh,

535
00:36:50.729 --> 00:36:58.239
participate perhaps in activities regarding, uh, the Children of

536
00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.320
their other o of other members of their family.

537
00:37:02.459 --> 00:37:05.889
Uh, AND, and that's the way by which they

538
00:37:05.899 --> 00:37:10.770
would increase indirectly their fitness, right? Because the part,

539
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.746
at least a percentage of their genes would also

540
00:37:13.756 --> 00:37:17.926
be in the bodies of, uh, uh, for example,

541
00:37:17.936 --> 00:37:23.065
their brothers or sisters, Children. And so they would,

542
00:37:23.075 --> 00:37:26.406
for example, help raise them. And that would be

543
00:37:26.416 --> 00:37:30.795
a way of at least indirectly increasing their own

544
00:37:30.805 --> 00:37:34.686
fitness. That's the hypothesis, the hypothesis you're going with

545
00:37:34.696 --> 00:37:35.545
there, right.

546
00:37:35.595 --> 00:37:39.451
Yes. This is the key selection prothesis to understand

547
00:37:39.461 --> 00:37:43.552
uh evolution of same sex uh attraction. Yeah. Mhm.

548
00:37:43.701 --> 00:37:46.201
Uh And uh do you know if this would

549
00:37:46.211 --> 00:37:51.721
apply to both uh male and female uh people

550
00:37:51.731 --> 00:37:57.922
with same sexual behavior or with same sex, behavioral

551
00:37:57.931 --> 00:38:02.612
attraction and uh sexual behaviors or not?

552
00:38:02.922 --> 00:38:08.179
Um There is uh some controversy in this area

553
00:38:08.189 --> 00:38:11.949
also with humans. Uh For example, uh there are

554
00:38:11.969 --> 00:38:16.320
also many hypo, many different hypotheses to understand uh

555
00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:21.840
SSB in humans. Uh The most prominent ones uh

556
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:27.514
tend to be the, the sexually antagonistic selection hypothesis

557
00:38:27.784 --> 00:38:31.104
and the king selection hypothesis. As uh you, you

558
00:38:31.114 --> 00:38:36.324
mentioned it uh also we have the fraternal, both

559
00:38:36.334 --> 00:38:42.245
all the hypothesis, which is more um approximate explanation.

560
00:38:42.495 --> 00:38:45.814
So uh it seems that we don't have a

561
00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:51.429
single answer for the SSB in, in women and

562
00:38:51.439 --> 00:38:55.120
men it seems that there are many, there are

563
00:38:55.129 --> 00:39:00.810
multiple pathways working on for the SSB in males

564
00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:06.219
and uh and females, for example, the organizational uh

565
00:39:06.229 --> 00:39:10.879
effects of androgens in, in, in the intro during

566
00:39:10.929 --> 00:39:15.500
life. It seems to be AAA better explanation for

567
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:22.090
SSSB in, in human females. And uh on from

568
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.949
the other side, the in selection hypothesis and the

569
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.409
fraternal uh both all the hypothesis might be the

570
00:39:28.419 --> 00:39:33.030
better explanation for SSB in, in adult human adult

571
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:33.870
males.

572
00:39:34.179 --> 00:39:37.489
Mhm So when it comes to these more proximate

573
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.489
explanations or some of these potential explanations, because as

574
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.110
you, as you said, there, we're still not completely

575
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:51.649
sure about the correct explanation behind SSB uh this

576
00:39:51.659 --> 00:39:56.350
could be something that is not, I mean, completely

577
00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.899
the result of just uh evolution but, but perhaps

578
00:40:00.909 --> 00:40:04.699
some contextual factors as well like in the case

579
00:40:04.709 --> 00:40:07.350
of the birth or the effect, I mean, that's

580
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:13.810
not uh straightforwardly the result of evolution but also

581
00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.419
in that particular case, the fact that uh one

582
00:40:17.439 --> 00:40:20.189
male, I guess, I guess we're talking about males

583
00:40:20.199 --> 00:40:23.439
exclusively. In that case, a male that comes uh

584
00:40:23.459 --> 00:40:26.929
in b in terms of the birth father, after

585
00:40:26.939 --> 00:40:32.050
the their or his brothers or sisters would tend

586
00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:36.709
to have a higher probability of being homosexual.

587
00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:41.530
Right? Yes. Yes. Yes. And I think that, that

588
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.850
we, as I, as I said before, that maybe

589
00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:48.439
there are many mechanisms working on, on to understand

590
00:40:48.449 --> 00:40:51.649
SSB and they might not be the same for,

591
00:40:51.969 --> 00:40:55.790
for human males and females. And I I would

592
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.620
say also that uh that, that are really uh

593
00:40:59.629 --> 00:41:03.209
interesting studies and some of them are really powerful.

594
00:41:03.459 --> 00:41:08.570
Uh But um it, it's, it's something that is

595
00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:13.360
also uh being developed at the moment because for

596
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:17.739
example, the king selection hypothesis provides uh evidence for

597
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:22.330
SSB in culture, in all Western culture, for example,

598
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.080
just like those of the Samoa Islands. But we

599
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:29.050
don't find uh support for the King selection hypothesis

600
00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.040
in the Western cultures, probably because in those societies,

601
00:41:33.439 --> 00:41:38.590
homosexuality and bisexuality are not fully accepted. And so

602
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.500
this makes uh may, may, may create uh a

603
00:41:42.659 --> 00:41:46.959
family problems between those individuals who present the SS

604
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:50.189
the SSP and their family. So they do not

605
00:41:50.199 --> 00:41:55.550
develop um intimate uh more, more stronger ties with

606
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.159
the family. Mhm

607
00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:02.290
So let's get into the topic of socio sexuality

608
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.040
here. That is also something that you've studied. So

609
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:08.760
what is the first of all? Perhaps, I guess

610
00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:12.500
you could explain a little bit what actually soc

611
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:17.209
socio sexuality is and then uh what role does

612
00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:20.870
it play when it comes to romantic relationships?

613
00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:26.679
Oh yes. Uh SOCIAL sexuality is defined as the

614
00:42:26.689 --> 00:42:34.020
individual disposition uh towards uncommitted sex. And it's usually

615
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:40.330
measured using the social, social sexual orientation inventory provides

616
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:45.120
the soar which is comprised of uh three different

617
00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:51.030
dimensions, the behavioral dimension, the attitudinal dimension and the

618
00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:57.550
desired dimension. Uh IN, in most studies, uh social

619
00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:02.389
sexuality tends to be higher uh which means that

620
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:07.770
people have more uh positive uh attitudes towards uncommitted

621
00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.489
sex or they have more sexual partners in men

622
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:18.320
compared to, to, to women. So, yes, I, I

623
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:19.020
would say.

624
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:25.850
Mhm And what? Yeah. And what explains individual differences

625
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:30.080
in socio sexuality? I mean, you mentioned their differences

626
00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:34.090
or general differences between men and women. But I,

627
00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.899
I would imagine that even among men and among

628
00:43:37.909 --> 00:43:42.489
women, we should find different uh levels of socio

629
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.469
sexuality across individuals.

630
00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:50.370
Right. Yes, indeed, indeed. That's exactly what we find.

631
00:43:50.459 --> 00:43:57.000
Social sexuality is a measure of uh individual differences.

632
00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:01.129
And this uh exactly what we find, for example,

633
00:44:01.219 --> 00:44:04.699
there is not only differences between men and women,

634
00:44:04.899 --> 00:44:10.850
but also in sexual orientation uh for, for more

635
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.219
than a decade, for one decade or, or, or

636
00:44:13.229 --> 00:44:17.129
more, we have an indication that gay men have

637
00:44:17.139 --> 00:44:22.500
a higher social sexuality than uh uh straight men,

638
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:29.000
for example, and singles, single individuals also tend to

639
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:33.229
have a higher social sexuality than individuals who are

640
00:44:33.239 --> 00:44:36.870
in a relationship. And that makes sense, right? Because

641
00:44:36.879 --> 00:44:39.229
uh if they do not do not have a

642
00:44:39.239 --> 00:44:44.050
relationship, they are on the searching mode for uh

643
00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.580
uh a partner. But it's interesting that I uh

644
00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:50.770
I, I have found this in different uh studies

645
00:44:50.979 --> 00:44:55.709
that uh even men uh regardless of their sexual

646
00:44:55.719 --> 00:45:01.669
orientation who are in a romantic relationship. Uh If

647
00:45:01.679 --> 00:45:04.770
they, if they have a high social sexuality, they

648
00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:10.750
actually have had more than one partner during the,

649
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.790
the last 12 months, uh the, the time in

650
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.330
which they were in, in this committed relationship. So

651
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.250
being in a relationship in some way decreases the

652
00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.639
level of social sexuality because maybe these, these people

653
00:45:27.649 --> 00:45:31.689
are more focused in one, in a single relationship,

654
00:45:31.949 --> 00:45:34.429
but it doesn't mean that they not have uh

655
00:45:34.439 --> 00:45:38.449
other relationships if they have a higher social sexuality.

656
00:45:39.179 --> 00:45:41.899
Mhm And, and I mean, I, I guess that

657
00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:46.139
there are other uh specific behaviors, for example, earlier

658
00:45:46.149 --> 00:45:53.719
you mentioned uh an increased uh predisposition to infidelity,

659
00:45:53.729 --> 00:45:56.810
cheating on their partners and so on. But I

660
00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.915
guess there would be other specific behaviors associated with

661
00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:05.614
uh socio sexuality. Like, for example, in, in your

662
00:46:05.625 --> 00:46:10.245
work, I read about earlier onset of sexual debut,

663
00:46:10.254 --> 00:46:14.645
reduced sexual disgust, risk taking behaviors. Right. So, could

664
00:46:14.655 --> 00:46:17.254
you tell us a little bit more about that?

665
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.719
Yes, for sure. Um If, if we consider the

666
00:46:23.729 --> 00:46:27.919
definition of social sexuality uh which is being wily

667
00:46:27.929 --> 00:46:32.560
to have uncommitted sex, uh one might uh expect

668
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:41.250
that for, for any individual to have unit that

669
00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.489
must be uh casual sex and otherwise people would

670
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.600
never do it. And some of those uh mechanisms,

671
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:53.679
some of those candidates are uh a lower sexual

672
00:46:53.689 --> 00:47:00.360
disgust and uh a higher risk taking behavior. Uh

673
00:47:01.229 --> 00:47:06.040
For example, uh if, if an individual is looking

674
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:10.169
for a casual sex and maybe it, it's not

675
00:47:10.179 --> 00:47:12.979
always the case that people who have uncommitted sex

676
00:47:12.989 --> 00:47:16.389
have sex with strangers but in some cases it

677
00:47:16.399 --> 00:47:21.409
happens that there are some strangers. Uh So if,

678
00:47:21.419 --> 00:47:24.239
if you don't, if you're not fully know this

679
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:28.169
person, uh you, you have to assume some risks

680
00:47:28.179 --> 00:47:31.310
when you have such intimate contact with this person.

681
00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:36.110
Right. Mhm. Uh For example, some studies uh found

682
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:42.260
that Tinder users, they have uh a not only

683
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:45.510
a higher social sexuality, but they also have a

684
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:50.260
lower level of sexual disgust and higher levels of

685
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:55.179
risk taking behaviors. I have unpublished data of this

686
00:47:55.189 --> 00:47:58.379
uh here in Brazil and I found exactly the

687
00:47:58.389 --> 00:48:04.020
same thing. Um Unfortunately, it's not published yet, but

688
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:07.010
uh we included in this, in this uh in

689
00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:13.699
this research, sexual orientation and um hookups apps who

690
00:48:13.709 --> 00:48:20.669
are more common uh among the LGBT QR community.

691
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.929
Um WHEN, when, when, when people use this hookups

692
00:48:24.939 --> 00:48:27.520
apps, they are more interested in casual sex and

693
00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:33.280
they very often have sex with strangers. So you,

694
00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:35.679
you, you assume some risk when you're doing that

695
00:48:35.689 --> 00:48:38.310
because you're going to find someone that you don't

696
00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.570
know and you're receiving this person in your place

697
00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:44.699
or you're going to, to this person place. And

698
00:48:44.709 --> 00:48:47.020
actually, we don't know what, what's going to happen.

699
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:52.419
Uh What we found was that uh the, the

700
00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:58.540
gay men who use hookups apps have higher social

701
00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:03.330
sexuality than the, the heterosexual men that use the

702
00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:07.449
same hookups apps. And they also have a higher

703
00:49:07.459 --> 00:49:10.709
sexuality compared to those gay men who are not

704
00:49:10.719 --> 00:49:15.540
users of this uh uh hookup apps. So there

705
00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:18.610
is uh this interaction between the use of the

706
00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:25.340
apps and the, the sexual uh the sexual orientation.

707
00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:29.040
Mhm So, uh let me ask you, by the

708
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:34.379
way, since you mentioned hookup apps and Tinder specifically

709
00:49:34.389 --> 00:49:37.350
there, let me ask you one question about that.

710
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.620
So, um you said that uh people who are

711
00:49:42.629 --> 00:49:46.520
on these apps tend to have higher levels of

712
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:51.070
socio sexuality than the general population. Correct?

713
00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:51.610
Yes.

714
00:49:51.669 --> 00:49:52.810
Yes. And so

715
00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.570
then they no users,

716
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.169
then the non users. So if that's the case,

717
00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:03.199
then uh wouldn't there be perhaps some limitations when

718
00:50:03.209 --> 00:50:06.909
it comes to, for example, when people try to

719
00:50:07.274 --> 00:50:11.215
uh use uh Tinder data and the data from

720
00:50:11.225 --> 00:50:15.774
other apps to, to extrapolate from that, from those

721
00:50:15.784 --> 00:50:19.495
data to the general population, in terms of, for

722
00:50:19.504 --> 00:50:24.875
example, behaviors by men and women. When it comes

723
00:50:24.885 --> 00:50:29.814
to the kinds of uh s partners or sexual

724
00:50:29.824 --> 00:50:32.915
partners they prefer. I mean, I, I'm, I'm asking

725
00:50:32.925 --> 00:50:36.534
you because many times we tend to assume that

726
00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:41.379
what w we would be, we would find happening

727
00:50:41.479 --> 00:50:45.810
in T on Tinder and other hookup app apps

728
00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:51.100
would uh correlate with behaviors that we find in

729
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:55.179
the general population. But maybe there are some limitations

730
00:50:55.189 --> 00:50:57.979
there in terms of how much we can extrapolate

731
00:50:57.989 --> 00:50:58.330
or

732
00:50:59.409 --> 00:51:02.300
Yes, for sure. I would say that the, the

733
00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:07.770
this methodology that compares users and the users is

734
00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.729
more related to the fact that the users of

735
00:51:10.739 --> 00:51:14.510
hookups apps are in some way in the search

736
00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:18.540
mode of the uh to find, to find a

737
00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:23.179
new uh new partners. Uh Of course, they, this,

738
00:51:23.189 --> 00:51:28.030
this apps uh show to people many different people.

739
00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:31.590
So they, they can get to know each other

740
00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.409
only swiping right, or swiping left or sending a

741
00:51:36.419 --> 00:51:40.280
message. So it's very easily and you can do

742
00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:44.439
this seated on your, in your sofa, right. It,

743
00:51:44.919 --> 00:51:47.449
it's, it's, it's, it's not so costly to do

744
00:51:47.459 --> 00:51:49.560
that. It's very different when you are in a

745
00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:53.790
social interaction regularly with other people. So you can

746
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.030
focus only one person at a time. But uh

747
00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.840
yes, I, I do agree with you. We cannot

748
00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:03.429
uh generalize what people do on this uh on

749
00:52:03.439 --> 00:52:06.629
these apps. But, but they are also interesting to,

750
00:52:06.639 --> 00:52:10.600
to compare the behavior of users and non users.

751
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.389
Mhm No, I, I mean, I agree. It's just

752
00:52:13.399 --> 00:52:16.729
that I was uh asking or perhaps pointing to

753
00:52:16.739 --> 00:52:20.790
the fact that maybe uh at least in certain

754
00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.909
cases, we have to be a little bit more

755
00:52:23.054 --> 00:52:27.754
careful when assuming that the way people or users

756
00:52:27.764 --> 00:52:32.955
of these apps would behave, there would uh mirror

757
00:52:32.965 --> 00:52:36.695
the way that people uh that are non users

758
00:52:36.705 --> 00:52:40.175
or the general population would behave in a sort

759
00:52:40.185 --> 00:52:44.264
of real life situation or context.

760
00:52:44.504 --> 00:52:46.534
Right? Yes. Yes. In this case, I, I do

761
00:52:46.544 --> 00:52:49.824
agree with you. We cannot make this generalization. Mhm

762
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:55.229
And do levels of socio sexuality correlate then with

763
00:52:55.239 --> 00:53:00.669
different mating strategies in terms of people being more

764
00:53:00.679 --> 00:53:04.550
short term or long term oriented, for example.

765
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.689
Oh yes. Oh yes. Uh We have to remember

766
00:53:08.699 --> 00:53:13.270
that socials, social sexuality is indeed a measure of

767
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:18.530
a short term image orientation. Um It's, it's not

768
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:21.800
uh it's something that I really advise people when

769
00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:25.590
I'm talking about. This is the fact that uh

770
00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:30.229
people that who are higher on social sexuality, they

771
00:53:30.239 --> 00:53:34.320
can also form long term relationships. It's not deterministic,

772
00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:39.050
right? Uh And this is one of the, the

773
00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:44.649
reasons why the, the soy especially or the conceptualization

774
00:53:44.659 --> 00:53:49.080
of social sexuality has been criticized by not fully

775
00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:55.350
capturing the, the all possibilities of m orientations in

776
00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:59.939
humans, but instead, it's for causing only on the

777
00:53:59.949 --> 00:54:05.580
short term M orientation. Uh And that makes sense

778
00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:08.909
because when, when you use the soy R, we,

779
00:54:08.919 --> 00:54:13.270
we are actually measuring how many partners people had

780
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.570
in the last 12 months or in how many

781
00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.649
pa partners they had in their, in their whole

782
00:54:18.659 --> 00:54:22.209
life. So if you have a higher level of

783
00:54:22.219 --> 00:54:26.199
uh sexual partners on, on these measures, you are

784
00:54:26.209 --> 00:54:31.429
uh more short term uh orientated than other people.

785
00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.689
But indeed, there are some, there are some empirical

786
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.449
and theoretical shortcomings of all of these and, and,

787
00:54:38.459 --> 00:54:42.389
and, and, and some authors have indicated these shortcomings

788
00:54:42.459 --> 00:54:46.370
about the conceptualization of, of, of the social sexuality.

789
00:54:46.699 --> 00:54:52.389
But uh despite this, these limitations and, and also

790
00:54:52.399 --> 00:54:56.360
at the same time, in in accordance of uh

791
00:54:56.370 --> 00:55:01.120
of this uh conceptualization uh people with higher social

792
00:55:01.129 --> 00:55:06.169
sexuality, they, they actually tended to, to be, to

793
00:55:06.179 --> 00:55:12.760
have more extra pair uh uh relationships. They, they,

794
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:15.949
for example, that there is a recent study that

795
00:55:15.959 --> 00:55:20.209
shows that social sexuality is a powerful predictor of

796
00:55:20.219 --> 00:55:25.780
voluntary singlehood both in men and women. And as

797
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.500
I, as I told you before, uh even if

798
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:31.340
they are in a relationship, they, they tend to

799
00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:34.790
have higher uh number of partners than those who

800
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.709
have a restricted social sexuality. So I would say

801
00:55:38.719 --> 00:55:43.139
that indeed, social sex, social sexuality is a measure

802
00:55:43.149 --> 00:55:45.340
of a short term and mating orientation.

803
00:55:45.899 --> 00:55:50.409
Mhm So a very interesting study that you did

804
00:55:50.419 --> 00:55:54.649
was that you studied the socio sexuality during the

805
00:55:54.659 --> 00:55:59.050
COVID-19 pandemic. What could you tell us about it?

806
00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:02.590
Like uh for example, was there any correlation between

807
00:56:02.850 --> 00:56:08.290
socio sexuality and the adoption of social distancing measures

808
00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:10.870
to prevent the transmission of COVID? And I mean,

809
00:56:10.879 --> 00:56:13.824
I would imagine that if that was the case,

810
00:56:13.834 --> 00:56:16.844
it would probably have something to do with people

811
00:56:16.854 --> 00:56:21.504
who score higher on socio sexuality also scoring higher

812
00:56:21.514 --> 00:56:24.715
on risk taking behaviors,

813
00:56:24.844 --> 00:56:28.024
right? Oh, yes, I, I believe yes. And thanks

814
00:56:28.034 --> 00:56:31.125
for the for the question. Uh THAT, that was

815
00:56:31.135 --> 00:56:34.385
an interesting stu study that I carried out with

816
00:56:34.395 --> 00:56:38.185
two colleagues of mine during the worst phases of

817
00:56:38.195 --> 00:56:41.760
the pandemic here uh here in Brazil. And just

818
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:46.969
to give you uh some background uh of this

819
00:56:46.979 --> 00:56:51.399
study, we, we carried out this study during this

820
00:56:51.409 --> 00:56:54.239
phase of the pandemic, at the, at that time,

821
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:58.760
we didn't have vaccines and as other countries in

822
00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:03.530
the world, uh the pandemic was very poorly in

823
00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:07.580
Brazil. So there were people who did not believe

824
00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:11.000
that was a serious issue and they felt uh

825
00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:16.949
comfortable uh for not wearing masks and uh getting

826
00:57:16.959 --> 00:57:22.419
around with other people. Uh So the, the, the

827
00:57:22.429 --> 00:57:27.600
theoretical question that motivated this study was to understand

828
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:31.219
if there was some kind of trade off uh

829
00:57:31.229 --> 00:57:34.780
that people might be experiencing at the time. Uh

830
00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:38.320
For example, in the beginning of the pandemic, uh

831
00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:40.949
we didn't know for sure how much long it

832
00:57:40.959 --> 00:57:45.899
would take to, to stay at home, right? Uh

833
00:57:45.909 --> 00:57:49.189
It's relatively OK if you do this for a

834
00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:53.709
month maybe. Uh But if the quarantine uh takes

835
00:57:53.719 --> 00:57:57.669
longer, like two months, four months, six months or

836
00:57:57.679 --> 00:58:03.290
maybe a year, it, it uh requires more effort

837
00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:08.949
of people to doing that and actually staying in

838
00:58:08.959 --> 00:58:12.399
the quarantine for a long period uh affects your

839
00:58:12.409 --> 00:58:15.959
life in, in, in many ways in, in, in,

840
00:58:15.969 --> 00:58:18.469
in, in general, like for example, you're not seeing

841
00:58:18.479 --> 00:58:22.139
your family, but also you're not having contact with

842
00:58:22.149 --> 00:58:26.780
romantic partners or sexual partners. If you have uh

843
00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.260
if you are single, that might be even more

844
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:33.000
difficult because maybe you have uh this uh uh

845
00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:37.100
uh those needs and you, you, you don't have

846
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:40.229
a partner uh with whom who we may share

847
00:58:40.239 --> 00:58:43.810
this intimacy. So that was exactly in the point

848
00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:49.620
we were interested if people would um prevent uh

849
00:58:49.629 --> 00:58:55.129
the COVID infection or they would uh present this

850
00:58:55.139 --> 00:59:02.320
risk behavior to satisfy those needs. Um We collected

851
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:06.500
data only with men with different sexual orientations, bisexuals,

852
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:09.840
gays and heterosexuals. And I think we had more

853
00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:14.110
than a 500 individuals from all o all regions

854
00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:18.360
of Brazil. Uh And what, what the new results

855
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:22.510
showed that a minority of those men were uh

856
00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:28.520
fully following the, the guidance of staying at home,

857
00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:32.560
only a minority of them. And a great proportion

858
00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:39.139
of those men uh actually uh had some kind

859
00:59:39.149 --> 00:59:45.139
of uh uncommitted sex with someone. They, they, they

860
00:59:45.149 --> 00:59:48.500
were not in all cases, strangers, but in some

861
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:53.169
cases, those people were strangers and with a greater

862
00:59:53.179 --> 00:59:58.290
concern uh with strangers, some of those men had

863
00:59:58.300 --> 01:00:03.350
uh uh an unprotected sex. So they, they took

864
01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.489
the risks, the risk of getting two different kinds

865
01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.810
of infections, the COVID, the COVID, the, the Coronavirus

866
01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:16.949
and the, the sexual

867
01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:17.489
admitted

868
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:23.169
infection infections. Yes, thank you. Um And as you,

869
01:00:23.179 --> 01:00:25.659
as you, as you, as you said, uh there

870
01:00:25.669 --> 01:00:30.530
was uh a correlation between social sexuality and an

871
01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:35.949
earlier onset of uh sexual debut. Uh And I

872
01:00:35.959 --> 01:00:38.929
think, I think this study is important, not only

873
01:00:38.939 --> 01:00:43.969
because uh it provided more information about individual differences

874
01:00:43.979 --> 01:00:48.600
in social sexuality, but this, this study can inform

875
01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:54.459
public policies because uh provides information that uh in

876
01:00:54.469 --> 01:00:58.229
a situation like the pandemic that was really unusual

877
01:00:58.439 --> 01:01:02.330
uh for, for all of us, people will not

878
01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:05.610
behave in the same way even if they have

879
01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.850
the same information. So if the governments, for example,

880
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.570
wants to inform people and uh encourage them to

881
01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:15.729
behave in a certain way to avoid uh the

882
01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:19.250
spread of the virus, they have to take into

883
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:23.459
account that not, not everyone will behave in a,

884
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:26.080
in a similar way because people are not similar,

885
01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:29.879
they have their differences and not only about social

886
01:01:29.889 --> 01:01:34.760
sexuality or risk taking behaviors, but in many others.

887
01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:37.459
So as more we know about this uh about

888
01:01:37.469 --> 01:01:41.500
the individual differences, more we are able to uh

889
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:48.040
maybe uh really, really be effective in public policies

890
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:51.040
such as those related to, to the pandemic.

891
01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:54.800
So perhaps in that specific case, if we take

892
01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:58.699
into account individual differences, we would have to tailor

893
01:01:58.879 --> 01:02:04.540
the message to the people with different uh personality

894
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:08.300
traits or with other different or with other individual

895
01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:10.629
differences like socio sexuality.

896
01:02:10.639 --> 01:02:12.820
Right? Indeed. Yes. Yes.

897
01:02:12.850 --> 01:02:16.300
Mhm And I guess just another comment before we

898
01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:19.564
get into another topic, I guess that this, that

899
01:02:19.574 --> 01:02:23.334
you did on socio sexuality during the COVID-19 pandemic

900
01:02:23.344 --> 01:02:26.354
point. Uh BECAUSE when I was asking the question,

901
01:02:26.364 --> 01:02:30.324
I mentioned that probably it was related to higher

902
01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:33.764
levels of risk taking behavior. But in that particular

903
01:02:33.774 --> 01:02:37.725
case, when you mentioned some of those individuals that

904
01:02:37.735 --> 01:02:42.534
didn't follow uh that didn't follow the social distancing

905
01:02:42.544 --> 01:02:47.570
measures uh having had sex. Uh AND protected sex

906
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:54.050
specifically. Perhaps it also relates to reduced sexual disgust

907
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:55.090
on their part.

908
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:57.939
Can you, can you, can you explain more about

909
01:02:57.949 --> 01:02:58.280
this?

910
01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:00.489
Yeah, I I mean, I I was saying that

911
01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:04.370
if some of those individuals that you mentioned there

912
01:03:04.379 --> 01:03:10.129
uh had unprotected uh sex with the partners they

913
01:03:10.139 --> 01:03:14.495
have, then that in terms of these being to

914
01:03:14.504 --> 01:03:19.135
socio sexuality, perhaps it would also be a manifestation

915
01:03:19.145 --> 01:03:23.854
of their reduced sexual disgust or, or

916
01:03:23.864 --> 01:03:26.294
not. Hypothetically speaking.

917
01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:26.925
Yes.

918
01:03:27.764 --> 01:03:30.945
Yes. Yes. Yes. Because yes, this is important question

919
01:03:30.955 --> 01:03:35.705
because we didn't measure social disgust. And we me,

920
01:03:35.864 --> 01:03:39.574
we measured risk taking behavior indirectly by the measure

921
01:03:39.584 --> 01:03:43.479
of following or not the, the the guidelines of

922
01:03:43.489 --> 01:03:45.500
staying at home. Yeah. But I was saying,

923
01:03:45.919 --> 01:03:48.830
yeah, that's an important clarification. But it was, I

924
01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.770
was just saying hypothetically. Sure.

925
01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:52.939
Yes. Yes, I agree.

926
01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:58.870
So let's get them into mating systems in humans.

927
01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:02.260
Um Of course, I, I guess that uh I

928
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:04.270
don't know if you agree with me, but I

929
01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.669
guess that from the discussions I had on the

930
01:04:06.679 --> 01:04:12.149
show with evolutionary psychologists and anthropologists in general, there

931
01:04:12.159 --> 01:04:17.570
are three main mating systems in human societies, monogamy,

932
01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:21.389
polygyny, and polyandry. So, but uh how do you

933
01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:26.100
approach mating systems from an evolutionary perspective?

934
01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:31.169
OK. Um I think the mating systems uh we,

935
01:04:31.179 --> 01:04:35.310
we have to, to understand that they represent uh

936
01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:39.510
a pattern of sexual behavior that is found at

937
01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.830
the species level or at the population level. We're

938
01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.770
not talking about uh uh individuals like we have

939
01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:50.149
been talking uh previously. Yeah. What, what, what do

940
01:04:50.159 --> 01:04:52.800
we, what do we know about uh mating systems

941
01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:57.060
is more related to the primate literature? And what,

942
01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:01.229
what we can say about primates is that primates

943
01:05:01.239 --> 01:05:07.189
usually have uh a primary mating system, but they

944
01:05:07.629 --> 01:05:11.550
might have a secondary and, or a tertiary mating

945
01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.209
system. Ok. So, in humans, when it comes to

946
01:05:15.219 --> 01:05:19.290
humans, there is a debate if our primary mating

947
01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:24.909
system is monogamy or polygyny, right? Uh In the

948
01:05:24.919 --> 01:05:28.959
past, in the early two thousands, uh there was

949
01:05:28.969 --> 01:05:34.639
more agreement that the majority of societies were more

950
01:05:34.649 --> 01:05:41.159
uh polygynous societies. And, but nowadays, uh it seems

951
01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:44.239
for me, I, I'm not following exactly uh the,

952
01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:47.199
the, the literature on this topic. But II, I

953
01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:51.159
tend to think that uh anthropologists have been uh

954
01:05:51.169 --> 01:05:56.149
suggesting that there are more monogamous societies uh nowadays.

955
01:05:56.159 --> 01:05:59.209
And the, the reason for that is because uh

956
01:05:59.219 --> 01:06:03.459
of the cultural contact between different cultures, especially the

957
01:06:03.469 --> 01:06:09.850
cultures in, in the West. Um But despite the

958
01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:15.360
fact that uh 24 years ago, uh this study

959
01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:19.969
showed that there was more polygamous societies uh in

960
01:06:19.979 --> 01:06:25.479
the worlds, most of people were monogamous and, and

961
01:06:25.489 --> 01:06:30.239
advised that because even if the society allows, allows

962
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:33.310
some men, uh we we, we actually found more

963
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:38.560
poly society than polyandry societies. And even if those

964
01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:42.459
uh societies allows men to, to have more than

965
01:06:42.469 --> 01:06:46.149
one than one wife, not all, all men in

966
01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:50.199
those societies can afford to have larger families. So

967
01:06:50.209 --> 01:06:52.810
even if they want to have larger families, they

968
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:56.310
cannot afford for this because of material resources. They

969
01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.449
do not, uh they do not uh they do

970
01:06:59.459 --> 01:07:05.790
not have. Um And, and the, the, the, the

971
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:09.550
point, the point that I understand about the mating

972
01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:14.830
systems in humans is the specific benefits and tradeoffs

973
01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:19.459
related to uh sorry, the benefits and costs uh

974
01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.820
uh in, in which societies uh develop some kind

975
01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:28.459
of uh uh mating systems from monogamy to poly

976
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:34.409
polyandry or monogamy. Uh It seems that the, the

977
01:07:34.419 --> 01:07:40.320
social ecology plays a significant role in the adoption

978
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:44.810
of this mating systems in humans. Uh THE ability

979
01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:49.129
of men to have more uh resources but also

980
01:07:49.139 --> 01:07:52.959
which sex is responsible for the material resources in

981
01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:56.739
the societies of, in, in the societies and many

982
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:59.600
others. Uh SOCIO ecological factors.

983
01:08:00.179 --> 01:08:06.270
Mhm. But can we say if there's a predominant

984
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.520
mating system in human societies? Because uh as you

985
01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.909
mentioned there and from the conversations I had with,

986
01:08:13.919 --> 01:08:17.950
for example, anthropologists on the show, uh I guess

987
01:08:17.959 --> 01:08:20.540
that uh you, you what you said there is

988
01:08:20.549 --> 01:08:25.959
up to date that most traditional societies that we

989
01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:32.279
studied until recently were uh predominantly polygynous. But now

990
01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:36.100
in more recent times, they tend to be more

991
01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:39.970
monogamous. I mean, most societies across the globe and

992
01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:43.609
the, the bigger ones at least. So, uh I

993
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.700
mean, can we really say that we as humans

994
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:53.009
have one predominant or primary mating system or, I

995
01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.819
mean, is that, is, is it that it just

996
01:08:56.830 --> 01:09:01.100
depends on our socio ecology and that's all we

997
01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:03.160
can say about it.

998
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:05.160
But that's a big question. I don't, I don't

999
01:09:05.169 --> 01:09:07.979
know if I'm the best person to, to, to

1000
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:13.408
tell you that. But uh my, my perspective on

1001
01:09:13.417 --> 01:09:17.889
this is that the mating systems in, in humans

1002
01:09:17.898 --> 01:09:21.837
or other primates are the results of the interactions

1003
01:09:21.849 --> 01:09:26.238
of the interaction of our evolved mechanisms and the

1004
01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:31.278
environment, right? Uh So I would say that if

1005
01:09:31.288 --> 01:09:36.318
most of societies adopt one mating system of the

1006
01:09:36.328 --> 01:09:40.068
oo other depends on their interaction of those factors.

1007
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.270
Uh And of course, we have to take into

1008
01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:49.540
account the specific historical moment. We are considering maybe

1009
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:54.720
uh 10, 10,000 years ago, we would have a

1010
01:09:54.729 --> 01:10:01.220
different uh a a AAA different predominant mating system

1011
01:10:01.439 --> 01:10:07.290
in humans. Uh But 24 years ago, anthropologists tend

1012
01:10:07.299 --> 01:10:11.720
to think that polygamy was the most predominant. And

1013
01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:15.750
now we say that is monogamy. And I think

1014
01:10:15.759 --> 01:10:20.819
that polygamy and monogamy may be um the the

1015
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:24.339
most important ones uh in, in, in, in the

1016
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:28.720
sense of, of how frequent they are. But that

1017
01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:32.100
depends of course, of the timescale we are considering,

1018
01:10:32.109 --> 01:10:38.740
right? Because uh evolutionary processes are also historical processes

1019
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:41.500
and we have to take into account the, the

1020
01:10:41.509 --> 01:10:47.479
timescale when we make this uh this uh conclusions

1021
01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:49.879
or these assertions. Mhm

1022
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:53.240
So, I, I mean, it's not really correct to

1023
01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:58.220
say that we are, for example, a monogamous species

1024
01:10:58.229 --> 01:11:01.490
or a polygynous species. I mean, that doesn't make

1025
01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.330
much sense.

1026
01:11:02.919 --> 01:11:05.109
No, no. Yes, I would say that doesn't make

1027
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.750
sense. II, I would say actually that we have

1028
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:13.930
many psychological adaptations that allowed us to develop uh

1029
01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:19.560
mating systems at the population level, regarded to monogamy

1030
01:11:19.569 --> 01:11:23.470
or poly or uh polygamous mating systems.

1031
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.790
And then of course, there's also these are rarer

1032
01:11:27.799 --> 01:11:32.009
cases, but there's also cases of polyandrous societies. Like

1033
01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:35.259
for example, if I remember correctly, there are some

1034
01:11:35.529 --> 01:11:41.240
uh agricultural societies in the Himalayas in Nepal, for

1035
01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:46.950
example, where uh two brothers married the same woman

1036
01:11:46.959 --> 01:11:49.990
because I mean, the I guess that uh the

1037
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.870
main rationale behind that is that since they are

1038
01:11:52.879 --> 01:11:58.490
an agricultural society, if the two brothers married different

1039
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:02.600
women, then when they inherited the land, they would

1040
01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:05.350
have to divide it between the two of them.

1041
01:12:05.359 --> 01:12:08.200
And so they would get smaller portions and they

1042
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:11.560
wouldn't really be able to get good enough yields

1043
01:12:11.569 --> 01:12:14.720
from those smaller portions of land. And so two

1044
01:12:14.729 --> 01:12:19.629
brothers married the same woman and uh the Children

1045
01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.709
are considered Children of the both of them. But

1046
01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:28.915
still, even though there's the uh issue of paternity,

1047
01:12:28.924 --> 01:12:33.145
uncertainty in that case, that sort of buffered by

1048
01:12:33.154 --> 01:12:36.884
the fact that since they are brothers, they share,

1049
01:12:36.895 --> 01:12:40.464
they share a big percentage of their DNA. And

1050
01:12:40.475 --> 01:12:44.944
so the conflict there is reduced between

1051
01:12:44.955 --> 01:12:49.375
reduced. Yes, indeed, that's one important uh aspect of

1052
01:12:49.384 --> 01:12:51.875
this. They, they, they tend to be brothers.

1053
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:56.310
Yeah. So, I mean, I guess that we've already

1054
01:12:56.319 --> 01:12:59.660
touched on the question as to whether there are

1055
01:12:59.669 --> 01:13:03.859
differences between mating systems in ancient human societies compared

1056
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:07.620
to more modern human society. So, uh let me

1057
01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:10.270
ask you another kind of question that this will

1058
01:13:10.279 --> 01:13:13.379
probably be the last question of our conversation today.

1059
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:18.129
What do you think specifically about polyamory? Because there

1060
01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:23.740
are people that argue that polyamory is distinct from

1061
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:27.959
uh any form of polygamy, like polygyny or polyandry.

1062
01:13:28.339 --> 01:13:31.080
Do, do you look at it as a distinct

1063
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:33.359
mating system or not?

1064
01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:37.500
Uh To be honest, I haven't thinking uh I

1065
01:13:37.509 --> 01:13:42.120
haven't thought about this uh about polyamory, but uh

1066
01:13:42.129 --> 01:13:45.580
I would say that polyamory is not the same

1067
01:13:45.589 --> 01:13:48.959
as a mating system. Uh If, if you remember,

1068
01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:52.399
we, we, we remember the definition of mating system,

1069
01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:55.520
mating systems happens at the level of a population

1070
01:13:55.529 --> 01:13:58.620
or at the level of a species. Uh I

1071
01:13:58.629 --> 01:14:01.279
would say that polyamory is more related to the

1072
01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:06.560
individual level of analysis and maybe is related to

1073
01:14:06.569 --> 01:14:12.839
the benefits and costs that individuals uh uh find

1074
01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:17.549
in their, in their environment. Uh As, as as

1075
01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.640
I, as I mentioned it. Uh PREVIOUSLY, I believe

1076
01:14:21.649 --> 01:14:26.299
we have many psychological adaptations that allowed us to

1077
01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:31.339
uh to form uh different kinds of uh arrangements

1078
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:36.759
of romantic arrangements that depends of what is available

1079
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:41.589
to a specific individual uh in, in western societies

1080
01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.660
in industrialized societies, more and more people are thinking

1081
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:52.629
about the, the costs of having a single part

1082
01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:57.649
for a long period of time because people are

1083
01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:03.930
able to develop interests, uh romantic or sexual interacts,

1084
01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:07.660
interest for other people. And they might compromise the

1085
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:11.470
relationship if they, they have with a long term

1086
01:15:11.479 --> 01:15:16.169
partner. So there are people out uh discussing this

1087
01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:20.890
uh uh these challenges and they uh kind of

1088
01:15:20.899 --> 01:15:24.979
uh suggest that polyamory would be a solution. Uh

1089
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:29.029
If it, because people would be, would would in

1090
01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.399
a consensual way uh from, from both, from both

1091
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:39.069
uh parts uh maybe develop uh more uh the

1092
01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.669
one relation, longer term relationship at a time, right?

1093
01:15:44.089 --> 01:15:47.180
And one of 11 of it, it's, it's interesting

1094
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:50.350
to analyze the trends because one of the, the

1095
01:15:50.359 --> 01:15:55.069
arguments that people say is that poly polyamory already

1096
01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:59.779
existed. Uh It, it, it was only not allowed

1097
01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:03.520
or men were allowed to, to, to develop more

1098
01:16:03.529 --> 01:16:06.410
than one romantic relationship at a time and women

1099
01:16:06.419 --> 01:16:09.220
were not. But the question, the question is, I

1100
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:13.290
think answering your, your question is not, polyamory is

1101
01:16:13.299 --> 01:16:16.810
not a mating system because mating systems happens at

1102
01:16:16.819 --> 01:16:21.689
a different level. But we are perfectly able to,

1103
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:26.259
to develop uh this because as we see in

1104
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:31.839
societies that have polyandry or polygyny, uh it's perfectly

1105
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:35.759
possible to have mo more than one partner uh

1106
01:16:35.819 --> 01:16:38.319
at the same time. So uh I believe that

1107
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:42.330
we, we, we, we have this, this um uh

1108
01:16:42.339 --> 01:16:47.100
possibility. It, it was only the environment that did

1109
01:16:47.109 --> 01:16:51.799
not accept maybe the, our cultural, our cultural restrictions

1110
01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:55.189
to, to these that were more orientated to, uh,

1111
01:16:55.209 --> 01:16:57.490
a monogamy lifestyle.

1112
01:16:58.299 --> 01:17:03.350
Mhm. Yes. And in this particular case, I guess

1113
01:17:03.359 --> 01:17:07.299
that, uh, some of the reasons why people who

1114
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:12.009
talk about polyamory, distinguish it from something like, uh,

1115
01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:16.290
polygyny or polyandry or some form of polygamy is

1116
01:17:16.299 --> 01:17:21.859
the fact that many times across human societies, uh

1117
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:27.839
a poly polygamous relationship is based on uh marriage.

1118
01:17:27.850 --> 01:17:31.029
I mean, there's marriage associated with it, but in

1119
01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:36.209
polyamory, not necessarily. And also, I guess that in

1120
01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:41.459
polyamory we're not talking, we're not talking about uh

1121
01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:47.680
uh necessarily long term romantic relationships. But it can

1122
01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:52.180
be, for example, a romantic relationship with one partner

1123
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:57.000
and then with the others just uh sexual relationships

1124
01:17:57.009 --> 01:18:01.399
or relationships that are simply sexual in their nature.

1125
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:05.229
Right? Yeah. Yes. Yes, I agree. I agree.

1126
01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:10.750
Ok. Great. So, um Mauru just before we go,

1127
01:18:10.759 --> 01:18:13.810
uh would you like to tell people what are

1128
01:18:13.819 --> 01:18:16.640
the things you're working on at the moment or

1129
01:18:16.649 --> 01:18:19.720
we'll be working on in the near future if

1130
01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:20.959
people are interested?

1131
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:25.529
Yes. Uh I'm working on uh individual differences in

1132
01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:31.009
social sexuality and uh the factors that affect uh

1133
01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:37.680
relationship satisfaction. And more recently, I, I became interested

1134
01:18:37.689 --> 01:18:42.459
in the study of emotions from uh an evolutionary

1135
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:48.500
psychological perspective, like anger and uh and shame. II,

1136
01:18:48.509 --> 01:18:52.160
I, I'm at the beginning of, of this.

1137
01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:56.140
Mhm GREAT. And if people are interested, where can

1138
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:58.950
they find you when you work on the internet?

1139
01:19:00.279 --> 01:19:03.020
Uh THEY can find me on research Gates. I

1140
01:19:03.029 --> 01:19:06.779
have a profile there and I have also the

1141
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:11.450
Google citations uh uh profile. So it would be

1142
01:19:11.459 --> 01:19:15.180
easy to, to find me on those two platforms.

1143
01:19:15.509 --> 01:19:18.439
OK. I'm leaving links to that in the description

1144
