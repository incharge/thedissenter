00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.069
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.010
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.229
today I'm joined by Doctor Leo Papa. She is

4
00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:13.189
a tendered researcher at the Institute of Science, Cognitive

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.415
Mac uh Jan of the San Nacional de La

6
00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:21.965
Research Scientific in France and principal investigator of the

7
00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:26.065
research program, the Temple funded by a European Research

8
00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:31.344
Council starting grant. And today we're talking about social

9
00:00:31.354 --> 00:00:35.154
perception, basically what we pay attention to in other

10
00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:39.665
people and their interactions and the social information we

11
00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:42.595
get from that. So, Doctor Pao, welcome to the

12
00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:44.404
show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:46.529
Thanks for having me.

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.159
So when it comes to how we perceive other

15
00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:56.099
people, what are the kinds of things we usually

16
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.349
pay attention to?

17
00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.909
So um attention depends on um a number of

18
00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:08.519
things, depends on the salience of the stimuli. So

19
00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:12.029
how salient the stimuli are to our eyes. So

20
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.154
for instance, a bright red object is going to

21
00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:22.544
attract our attention more than a dark small object.

22
00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:26.245
But at the same time, attention also depends on

23
00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:29.654
our internal goals, what we are looking for in

24
00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:34.235
what we see. And so it's a very interesting

25
00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:39.485
balance between the outside world and our internal mental

26
00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:44.440
representation. And uh um so, in the case, when

27
00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:49.309
it comes to people, uh so others on specifics,

28
00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:53.250
um there are uh the first thing that like

29
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
the first thing that we attend to are, are

30
00:01:56.269 --> 00:02:02.790
the uh the research in cognitive neuroscience has suggested

31
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.029
that there is a sort of a hierarchy of

32
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.429
the things that we care about first and this

33
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.720
hierarchy goes by eyes, face and then the rest

34
00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:20.369
of the body. So, um but again, like a

35
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.029
what what we we attend first depends on what

36
00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.669
we are looking for in the outside world. So

37
00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.419
for instance, if we are looking, for instance, for

38
00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.610
an object, for an interaction with another person, we

39
00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.570
might, we might, we might be attending more the

40
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.910
limbs. So the arms, the hands than the face,

41
00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.080
but generally a good, a good summary is that,

42
00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.380
you know, the face and eyes come first.

43
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.179
But when we look at other people and will

44
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.600
later on in our conversation, we're going to get

45
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.660
into more detail in terms of, for example, when

46
00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.160
people are facing one another or in terms of

47
00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.279
how they uh present themselves in relation to 1

48
00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.600
to 1 another, what kinds of things we pay

49
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.320
attention to and what kinds of information we get

50
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.740
from those kinds of, let's say interactions? Are there

51
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:22.070
generally speaking, are there particular kinds of information that

52
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.850
we are looking for? When we perceive other people

53
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.860
in either in isolation or in interaction with others.

54
00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:38.250
Um So, um we pay attention to a lot

55
00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:41.449
of things uh because we, we care about a

56
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.830
lot of things. Uh But uh um we can

57
00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:51.050
uh synthesize these uh um the features that we

58
00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:56.720
care about in two categories. One is uh those

59
00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.000
features that help us to understand who is the

60
00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.580
other, who the other is, who are you And

61
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:06.759
the others are the features that uh uh help

62
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.500
us understand what are you doing? So there are

63
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:16.170
these two aspects of another that we consider very

64
00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:20.858
important for our immediate behavior and also for our

65
00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:24.179
survival. So when we look at another, at another

66
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.910
person, uh we are very efficient, our system, our

67
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.940
visual system is very efficient at extracting a number

68
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.739
of important pieces of information that allow to, for

69
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.200
instance, decide or establish surely the gender, the age,

70
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.984
we have very sensitive to the cues that suggest

71
00:04:49.994 --> 00:04:55.984
the age of our, of the other, the origin,

72
00:04:56.114 --> 00:04:59.915
the race. There are, there is a full line

73
00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:04.234
of research suggesting that there are very subtle ways

74
00:05:04.244 --> 00:05:07.765
in which difference in the race of the others

75
00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:12.399
affect our behavior. Um And uh uh of course,

76
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.980
uh also we can extract information from just the

77
00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:19.670
visual appearance by just looking at the others, we

78
00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:25.070
can start information about the status, for instance, how

79
00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:30.390
dominant the person is in the social hierarchy and

80
00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:33.559
the state. So the mental state, the mood of

81
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.269
the person. There are beautiful experiments showing that just

82
00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.489
by looking at the motion pattern. So the way

83
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.899
in which another uh moves we are very accurate

84
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.670
in determining uh uh their emotion, whether it is

85
00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:52.510
happy or sad and so on. And this is,

86
00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:55.029
you know, the category of features that I define

87
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.820
as those that allow us to understand who the

88
00:05:57.829 --> 00:06:02.799
other is. But then there is another set of

89
00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:07.470
features that we are very good at uh processing

90
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.750
and extracting from visual information from just looking at

91
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.760
the others, which are the features that allow us

92
00:06:13.769 --> 00:06:16.450
to understand what the other is up to what

93
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.910
it is about to do. Um And these features

94
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.679
are especially important in the context of social interaction.

95
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.690
So it's very important um to uh observe the

96
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.339
others interacting between each other with each other to

97
00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:35.649
construct a number of features that allow us to

98
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.570
understand. Uh AGAIN, is a role in the society

99
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.760
in a, in a specific context, but also more

100
00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:51.399
generally, um whether a person is uh um in

101
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.779
the, in the social hierarchy above or below the

102
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.670
other person, uh the level of intimacy, the social

103
00:06:59.679 --> 00:07:03.570
distance. Uh And also from the way in which

104
00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:08.390
two interact with each other, we can immediately understand

105
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.339
with a very fine sensitivity to the motion patterns,

106
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.660
the way in which people move and interact with

107
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.070
each other, whether they're having a they are in

108
00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:25.260
a friendly relationship, whether they're sharing the same goal

109
00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:28.459
or they are competing, whether they're helping each other

110
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:34.029
and so on. All these, all this information comes

111
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.899
out of almost a first glance to the others.

112
00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:42.940
A and B. By the way, uh, you mentioned,

113
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.700
uh, several different things there, like, for example, people's

114
00:07:47.709 --> 00:07:52.369
race or ethnicity, I mean, uh, uh, do we

115
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.109
know to what extent some of the things or

116
00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:58.309
the kinds of informations we, uh, the kind of

117
00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.399
information we want to acquire from other people and

118
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.700
the kinds of things and behaviors we pay attention

119
00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:07.674
to. I, if at least to some extent they

120
00:08:07.684 --> 00:08:11.994
are culturally learned. There is, I mean, my pay,

121
00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:17.184
paying attention to one person's ethnicity is something that

122
00:08:17.345 --> 00:08:20.954
I learn culturally to pay attention to or if

123
00:08:20.964 --> 00:08:23.285
all of these things or at least a few

124
00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:27.399
of them, uh, are sort of quote unquote, I

125
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.799
innate. There is even newborns already pay some attention

126
00:08:32.808 --> 00:08:37.159
to some of these features and behaviors. W what

127
00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.159
do we know exactly about that?

128
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.190
So that's, um, that's a very interesting question that

129
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.890
has been the subject of, uh, research for decades.

130
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.460
Uh And, uh, of course, there are many unknown,

131
00:08:50.469 --> 00:08:53.369
so many things that we don't know yet. But,

132
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.049
uh, uh, certainly, uh, we can say that humans

133
00:08:57.059 --> 00:09:02.260
are born with, uh, uh, innate, an innate or

134
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.544
at least very early when I say early, I

135
00:09:04.724 --> 00:09:11.945
mean, within hours from birth ability to recognize faces

136
00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:18.434
to detect a specific kind of motion which we

137
00:09:18.445 --> 00:09:22.224
call biological motion. And that's the specific way in

138
00:09:22.234 --> 00:09:26.755
which biological entities moves, that is very different. For

139
00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:31.440
instance, from the mechanical motion. Uh HUMANS are also

140
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:36.280
born with uh uh a very early capacity to

141
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:41.270
uh attend to the other side and know where

142
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.979
the others are looking at us. So when we

143
00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:48.280
are being addressed, relative to when the others are

144
00:09:48.289 --> 00:09:51.969
looking somewhere else, and we also have a very

145
00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:56.219
early uh and efficient capacity to follow the other

146
00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:58.489
gaze. So to know that's one of the first

147
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.770
thing, maybe the most important thing that we uh

148
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.580
look at when we process others where they're looking,

149
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:11.059
which anticipates or predicts what they are going to

150
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.330
do. So if they are looking at me, this

151
00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.229
is probably a signal, a very strong signal of

152
00:10:16.239 --> 00:10:19.799
social engagement is looking for social engagement is looking

153
00:10:19.809 --> 00:10:24.090
away, OK, where he or she is looking. So

154
00:10:24.099 --> 00:10:29.090
these are the things that uh infants within hours

155
00:10:29.099 --> 00:10:35.130
or days from birth are very sensitive to. And

156
00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:39.919
uh um we share many of these processes, many

157
00:10:39.929 --> 00:10:42.849
of these mechanisms that make us so efficient in

158
00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:49.010
processing socially relevant stimuli with non human species. Like

159
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.145
we have seen in a similar uh behaviors, very

160
00:10:53.155 --> 00:10:57.614
early behaviors in uh various species of monkeys, but

161
00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:01.705
also in uh uh chickens, for instance, or in

162
00:11:01.715 --> 00:11:05.195
a species that um are farther away from us.

163
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.150
Uh Then there are other aspects as you asked

164
00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:12.099
about the race or the age, there are other

165
00:11:12.109 --> 00:11:16.880
aspects that emerge relatively early. So there are, there

166
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.090
is, for instance, this phenomenon known as the, as

167
00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:25.109
the other race effect, which refers to the um

168
00:11:25.119 --> 00:11:30.440
to the basically very early sensitivity to uh people

169
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.859
or to individuals who are from a different race

170
00:11:34.869 --> 00:11:38.405
than ours. Uh There is something similar, for instance,

171
00:11:38.414 --> 00:11:44.364
in speech perception, this early sensitivity to differentiate between

172
00:11:44.484 --> 00:11:49.025
uh speech sound that are from our native language

173
00:11:49.034 --> 00:11:52.094
and speech sounds that are from another language. For

174
00:11:52.104 --> 00:11:57.474
instance, Indians have some uh uh uh uh sounds,

175
00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:00.385
some phonological sounds that we don't have like the

176
00:12:01.195 --> 00:12:05.114
the we don't have these sounds in our language.

177
00:12:05.275 --> 00:12:10.330
And very early on infants are capable of discriminating

178
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.049
between the sounds of their native language and sounds

179
00:12:13.059 --> 00:12:17.770
from other languages. But this is this kind of,

180
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.539
you know, sensitivity to these more culturally determined differences

181
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.130
um seems to be the result of a learning

182
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.719
process which operates very rapidly again, within months from

183
00:12:31.729 --> 00:12:37.005
birth, infants can make this subtle discrimination. But it's

184
00:12:37.015 --> 00:12:39.234
because when they are born, they are born and

185
00:12:39.244 --> 00:12:43.184
they are immediately immersed in a very rich social

186
00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:46.625
environment. And so they immediately pick up the features

187
00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:50.625
that are typical or their native social environment and

188
00:12:50.635 --> 00:12:55.094
immediately become capable of distinguishing those features that are

189
00:12:55.104 --> 00:12:58.945
very important from their integration in their own society,

190
00:12:58.955 --> 00:13:02.385
from uh features that don't belong to their own,

191
00:13:02.395 --> 00:13:05.025
to their own cultural uh group.

192
00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:08.840
So in my first question, one of the things

193
00:13:08.849 --> 00:13:12.059
you mentioned that people and also infants in this

194
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.830
case, pay lots of attention to is the face,

195
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.109
in particular features of the face, like the eyes.

196
00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:23.429
For example, eye gaze, uh apart from eye gaze,

197
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.549
what are some of the other features of the

198
00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:29.400
face that people tend to pay attention to? And

199
00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:32.679
what kinds of information do we get from that?

200
00:13:33.489 --> 00:13:37.190
Um The uh human ability to process a phase

201
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.880
is impressive. I would say that there is nothing

202
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:45.510
that uh uh uh there is nothing that is

203
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:52.789
so efficient, so uh tuned uh uh than the

204
00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:56.349
human ability for face perception. So just by looking

205
00:13:56.359 --> 00:13:59.000
at the face, we, as I said, we are

206
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:04.200
able to, first of all immediately recognize the identity

207
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:09.260
and discriminate between the two faces even when there

208
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.460
is a lot of similarity. Um And uh uh

209
00:14:13.469 --> 00:14:18.020
there are uh there are again, two different aspects,

210
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.770
uh two different categories of features that we uh

211
00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.590
uh one category is uh uh what allows us

212
00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:32.630
to identify a person. So as I said, to

213
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.349
categorize a person in terms of gender, race, age.

214
00:14:37.359 --> 00:14:40.799
And if we know the person also immediately assign

215
00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:43.289
a name to that person, an identity to that

216
00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:47.184
person. And so immediately retrieve all the, you know,

217
00:14:47.195 --> 00:14:50.674
knowledge and information that we have about that person.

218
00:14:50.684 --> 00:14:54.544
This this is a very rapid, very efficient mechanism.

219
00:14:54.825 --> 00:14:59.265
And then there is another uh family, another set

220
00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:04.619
of features that allows us to uh uh to

221
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.059
establish, to, to, to process the actions of the

222
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.950
face. And in the case of faces, actions uh

223
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:18.229
are uh manifestation of manifestation of two things. One

224
00:15:18.239 --> 00:15:21.599
is the communication. So by looking at faces, just

225
00:15:21.609 --> 00:15:24.940
the way in which the face move uh moves

226
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.732
is very important for uh speech perception. For we

227
00:15:29.742 --> 00:15:32.062
know that if we have access to the face

228
00:15:32.072 --> 00:15:36.862
of the speaker, our speech processing, so our ability

229
00:15:36.872 --> 00:15:39.622
to process and to understand what the speaker is

230
00:15:39.632 --> 00:15:42.802
saying is much more efficient. And there are a

231
00:15:42.812 --> 00:15:46.982
lot of interesting phenomena that show that in fact,

232
00:15:46.992 --> 00:15:52.413
the facial movements can affect also the acoustic signal,

233
00:15:52.422 --> 00:15:56.062
the acoustic information what we hear. So if I

234
00:15:56.072 --> 00:16:00.276
show him movement of the lips that is not

235
00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:06.265
compatible with the sound that I'm producing, that the

236
00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:09.705
speaker is producing. And there are very nice experiments

237
00:16:09.716 --> 00:16:14.596
that manipulate the mismatch between the lips movement and

238
00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:17.656
and the sound you see that we perceive a

239
00:16:17.666 --> 00:16:22.825
distorted sound, which means that what we see in

240
00:16:22.835 --> 00:16:25.736
the movements of the face affects what we hear.

241
00:16:26.289 --> 00:16:30.099
And also the second, the second type of action

242
00:16:30.109 --> 00:16:36.030
information conveys uh um information about emotions. We know

243
00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:38.809
that uh you know, very, we have a very

244
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:45.849
rich repertoire of facial uh actions that convey um

245
00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:52.840
as well rich um set of different emotions. And

246
00:16:52.849 --> 00:16:56.210
so these two family like the features to define

247
00:16:56.219 --> 00:17:00.049
who a person is and the features to define

248
00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:03.905
what the the face is doing is trying to

249
00:17:03.914 --> 00:17:09.285
communicate. Um OF course, are tightly related but can

250
00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:12.285
also be dissociated. And when I say dissociated, I

251
00:17:12.295 --> 00:17:15.944
imply that they are actually um features that are

252
00:17:15.954 --> 00:17:21.339
processes in partially different parts of the brain, of

253
00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:23.500
course, very strongly integrated.

254
00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.579
So now I would like to ask you about

255
00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.369
something very specific that I read about in your

256
00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.890
work. What is facing di perception? And does it

257
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.329
relate in any way to face perception?

258
00:17:40.689 --> 00:17:44.790
So um for many uh years, um for many

259
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.489
decades, cognitive neuroscience has studies. Of course, we have

260
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.680
this uh very strong uh and understandable interest uh

261
00:17:52.689 --> 00:17:56.880
for social perception, social cognition, how we understand how

262
00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.579
we recognize others. But for many decades, these questions

263
00:18:00.589 --> 00:18:04.420
have been, these questions have been addressed by uh

264
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:09.780
studying uh the perception of the processing of individual

265
00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:17.060
faces, individual bodies, individual movements. Uh UNTIL uh when

266
00:18:17.069 --> 00:18:22.959
um researchers including myself and the people working with

267
00:18:22.969 --> 00:18:27.439
me uh decided to see uh to study what

268
00:18:27.449 --> 00:18:30.770
happens to all these beautiful mechanism that I've been

269
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.339
talking about uh to process faces, motion bodies. When

270
00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:38.589
instead of seeing one face, one person, you see

271
00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:43.780
two people together, all these um sensitivity, all these

272
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.750
tuning to all these features is preserved or there

273
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.839
is something else that happens and what we have

274
00:18:51.849 --> 00:18:55.280
seen. So the main interesting result that we found

275
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.770
when we started asking this kind of question was

276
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.250
that as I said the faces are very special

277
00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.160
to our visual system and to the whole brain

278
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.119
because they are fundamental to understand interact, to recognize

279
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.900
others. But what we saw is that um when

280
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.420
we see instead of one phase, two phases, uh

281
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:24.890
all these uh very efficient uh uh processing uh

282
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:31.609
is preserved, particularly one, the others are perceived as

283
00:19:31.619 --> 00:19:35.119
if they are interacting, which means face to face.

284
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.750
So we did a very simple experiment. We, we

285
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.040
were studying, you know, the the efficiency of visual

286
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.489
recognition of multiple bodies. And so we presented the

287
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.910
pairs of bodies in different special configurations. And we

288
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.829
soon realized that subjects were particularly efficient at recognizing

289
00:19:56.839 --> 00:20:00.579
multiple bodies as efficient as they are at recognizing

290
00:20:00.589 --> 00:20:04.510
one face when these two bodies are put face

291
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.500
to face relative to when they are in any

292
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:13.510
other configuration. And so that was the first insight.

293
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.020
The first in the first uh uh piece of

294
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.140
information that suggests to us that there might be

295
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.939
something really special uh in the brain uh uh

296
00:20:23.949 --> 00:20:29.150
about uh uh the perception of what we call

297
00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:34.069
the facing diet. Now, why the fishing diet? Why

298
00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:36.930
two people face to face would be special to

299
00:20:36.939 --> 00:20:42.449
our visual system? Well, this is an open question

300
00:20:42.459 --> 00:20:47.010
but the intuitive response is that this configuration, when

301
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.910
we put two people face to face, this is

302
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:57.329
the prototypical configuration of human social interactions. So when

303
00:20:57.339 --> 00:21:00.689
we interact with others, we privilege this face to

304
00:21:00.699 --> 00:21:05.079
face positioning, because this face to face positioning gives

305
00:21:05.089 --> 00:21:09.979
us access to the other side to the others.

306
00:21:09.989 --> 00:21:14.020
Face full face. So we can extract information about

307
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.410
uh emotions. And uh also uh it gives us

308
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.699
access to the whole body. So it's the the

309
00:21:21.709 --> 00:21:25.979
perfect viewpoint to have as much information as possible

310
00:21:25.989 --> 00:21:29.939
from the other. And so to facilitate uh interaction.

311
00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.089
And so the idea is that this facial configuration,

312
00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:36.410
these are, these are face to face configuration of

313
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.400
body is so important for our social life and

314
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:46.479
so redundant. So, recurrent in our social environment that

315
00:21:46.489 --> 00:21:50.060
the human brain has developed a mechanism that make

316
00:21:50.069 --> 00:21:55.300
the processing of these two bodies especially efficient. And

317
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.239
this is confirmed by if we look at the

318
00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:01.959
uh evolutionary psychology literature, uh you know, people have

319
00:22:01.969 --> 00:22:08.459
studied uh how often humans spend, how much time

320
00:22:08.469 --> 00:22:13.670
humans spend in certain, you know, special positioning, special

321
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.420
positions relative to each other. And they have seen

322
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.599
that not just humans, but also monkeys and probably

323
00:22:20.609 --> 00:22:26.469
other species spend uh more than uh the 50%

324
00:22:26.479 --> 00:22:31.219
of their time in social interaction, facing, facing another.

325
00:22:31.229 --> 00:22:33.959
So face to face with another. And most of

326
00:22:33.969 --> 00:22:38.030
the time uh I I uh the most frequent

327
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:43.819
composition involves two people. So face to face di

328
00:22:44.069 --> 00:22:49.780
adding interaction seems to be uh an important uh

329
00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:55.660
recurrent uh uh structure in our social life in

330
00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:56.729
our social world.

331
00:22:57.969 --> 00:23:01.430
So this is already, I guess one aspect of

332
00:23:01.439 --> 00:23:07.160
studying social sin perception, right? And uh one of

333
00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.300
the things associated with that or a concept, I

334
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:15.310
guess in this case is minimal social sin. So

335
00:23:15.319 --> 00:23:19.530
what is that concept really about? And what can

336
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.390
you study through it?

337
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.140
So it's uh uh it's uh this idea of

338
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.260
minimal. So social scenes refer to what I've just

339
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.349
described. So when we started this research, we wanted

340
00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:34.699
to see to isolate, to get really like we,

341
00:23:34.709 --> 00:23:38.300
we see a lot of interactions, all kind of

342
00:23:38.449 --> 00:23:42.619
uh actions that people perform on each other or

343
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.540
with each other. Uh uh PEOPLE act uh in

344
00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.487
uh diets, in groups. So we have crowds of

345
00:23:49.496 --> 00:23:52.896
people doing things together so that the social interaction

346
00:23:52.906 --> 00:23:56.557
that the range of social interactions is possible. Social

347
00:23:56.567 --> 00:24:00.567
interactions is very broad. But we wanted to get

348
00:24:00.597 --> 00:24:05.107
to the minimal unit. What if we if we

349
00:24:05.116 --> 00:24:09.626
remove all the unnecessary features and we get to

350
00:24:09.636 --> 00:24:13.597
the core structure of the social interaction, what remains

351
00:24:14.524 --> 00:24:18.754
and what remains is this uh uh two body

352
00:24:18.764 --> 00:24:23.953
configuration. So this configuration that involves two bodies or

353
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:27.063
two phases in general, two people, two social agents

354
00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:32.884
facing closely like in special proximity and facing each

355
00:24:32.894 --> 00:24:37.104
other. So and this is this is really like.

356
00:24:37.114 --> 00:24:41.581
So we decided to study this configuration of two

357
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:45.090
bodies is a facing diet just like we have

358
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.571
studied other objects in visual perception, just like we

359
00:24:49.581 --> 00:24:52.801
have studied faces, we have studied bodies, we have

360
00:24:52.811 --> 00:24:56.220
studied any other object in the world, we consider

361
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.901
this a new object of visual perception. This is

362
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:03.401
a configuration which is the early rudimentary representation of

363
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:04.640
a social interaction.

364
00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.219
Uh And so, uh we've talked earlier about how

365
00:25:10.229 --> 00:25:14.560
people interpret when they see someone or a di

366
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:19.699
have of people facing each other. So apart from

367
00:25:19.709 --> 00:25:22.239
facing each other, what are perhaps some of the

368
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.520
other kinds of cues that people take in when

369
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:32.890
distinguishing between an interacting and a non interacting, died

370
00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:35.130
in crowds, for example.

371
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.130
Yeah. So we have uh again, just like in

372
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.040
the case of face perception, we are now this

373
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:45.609
is a very recent line of research that is

374
00:25:45.619 --> 00:25:49.130
really considering this new object of social perception, which

375
00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.839
is not one body, not one face, not one

376
00:25:51.849 --> 00:25:55.319
action but two people together. And so we are

377
00:25:55.329 --> 00:26:00.410
now discovering all the information that is rapidly extracted

378
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.689
from this stimuli. And so as you said, one

379
00:26:03.699 --> 00:26:07.855
is the relative positioning, what we call the facing

380
00:26:08.186 --> 00:26:10.836
where they are facing each other or not or

381
00:26:10.845 --> 00:26:13.066
they are facing away from each other. But there

382
00:26:13.076 --> 00:26:16.965
are another uh a large family of, of, of

383
00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:20.926
a large set of cues that uh uh we,

384
00:26:20.936 --> 00:26:25.436
we think and research suggests that are really relevant

385
00:26:25.446 --> 00:26:29.355
to process, to initiate the processing of social interaction.

386
00:26:29.365 --> 00:26:33.676
Some of of such cues are, for instance, as

387
00:26:33.686 --> 00:26:38.712
I said, the special proxy, how close in space

388
00:26:38.722 --> 00:26:42.062
to people are uh the touch, whether they are

389
00:26:42.072 --> 00:26:45.802
in contact, they are touching or not. So uh

390
00:26:45.812 --> 00:26:50.092
others are the mimicry, whether you know their body

391
00:26:50.102 --> 00:26:54.501
postures or their facial expression look alike, which means

392
00:26:54.511 --> 00:26:57.291
that which, which is a feature of the social

393
00:26:57.302 --> 00:27:00.352
interaction. When we interact with someone, we tend to

394
00:27:00.362 --> 00:27:06.319
have this automatic mimicry of their behavior. And we

395
00:27:06.329 --> 00:27:08.979
can see from outside when two people are interacting,

396
00:27:08.989 --> 00:27:13.199
they tend to uh imitate themselves, they tend to

397
00:27:13.209 --> 00:27:19.160
coordinate or to synchronize. So, coordinations, synchrony, miry um

398
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:24.199
distance openness like the typically people that are interacting

399
00:27:24.209 --> 00:27:28.729
and have this posture that is open to each

400
00:27:28.739 --> 00:27:32.862
other. And these are very uh measurable. We can

401
00:27:32.871 --> 00:27:37.921
take, you know, photos of interacting people and really

402
00:27:37.932 --> 00:27:42.302
measure all these things. And this is exactly what

403
00:27:42.312 --> 00:27:47.041
uh um scientists are doing right now. Uh First

404
00:27:47.052 --> 00:27:50.222
of all, to understand which are the the the

405
00:27:50.232 --> 00:27:53.462
the properties, the features of an interaction that we

406
00:27:53.482 --> 00:27:57.141
process, that we extract the uh uh from which

407
00:27:57.151 --> 00:28:01.484
we make is about the social relationship between two

408
00:28:01.494 --> 00:28:04.673
people. But also to understand whether there is a

409
00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:08.183
hierarchy between these things. So what is the relation

410
00:28:08.193 --> 00:28:10.713
between these things? We don't have the answer to

411
00:28:10.723 --> 00:28:14.843
this question yet. But you know, intuitively, 1 may

412
00:28:14.854 --> 00:28:18.043
think that if two people are face to face,

413
00:28:18.053 --> 00:28:21.813
they are probably interacting or this is what our

414
00:28:22.014 --> 00:28:27.776
brain spontaneously. But uh you know, if you start

415
00:28:27.786 --> 00:28:32.515
manipulating the distance, so you increase the distance between

416
00:28:32.526 --> 00:28:37.715
them, probably the effect of facings starts, you know,

417
00:28:37.725 --> 00:28:41.965
diminishing, diminishing. So and it would be interesting to

418
00:28:41.975 --> 00:28:47.345
see at which point, the distance breaks the effect

419
00:28:47.355 --> 00:28:51.209
of facings whether it does it at all. So

420
00:28:51.219 --> 00:28:53.939
basically, this is the kind of questions that we

421
00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:59.489
are now asking to um to, to understand how

422
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.290
because that's the thing. The question is not whether

423
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.650
we understand social interaction and what we understand about

424
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.780
social interaction. Because we do understand social interaction, we

425
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:15.255
are very, very rapid at you know, understanding what

426
00:29:15.265 --> 00:29:18.145
kind of relation there is between two people just

427
00:29:18.155 --> 00:29:22.545
by looking at these people. And uh we understand

428
00:29:22.555 --> 00:29:25.285
a lot of things, we can extract a lot

429
00:29:25.295 --> 00:29:28.564
of kind of information just by looking at how

430
00:29:28.574 --> 00:29:31.844
two people interact with each other. But the question

431
00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:36.449
that we're trying to answer is how we do

432
00:29:36.459 --> 00:29:40.130
it, how our brain does it. So this is

433
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.890
why it's important to understand. OK, what are the

434
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:49.410
basic cues that the visual system extracts from the

435
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.060
structure of the input or from what we see

436
00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:58.719
outside that starts this process that then leads to

437
00:29:58.729 --> 00:30:01.130
a full understanding of the social interaction.

438
00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:06.280
And of course, it's very interesting to understand or

439
00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:10.000
know what these basic cues are. I mean, the

440
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.760
basic kinds of things that people pay attention to

441
00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:17.349
in the social scene to perceive and interpret how

442
00:30:17.359 --> 00:30:20.530
people relate to one another and what people are

443
00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.239
doing that is socially relevant there. But I I

444
00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:28.089
would imagine that something that is also very interesting

445
00:30:28.099 --> 00:30:31.150
to understand these uh of course, we do this

446
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.099
and in the split of a second it's lots

447
00:30:34.109 --> 00:30:38.150
of information but we process it very, very quickly.

448
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.689
But at the same time, I mean, it's not

449
00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:46.229
like isolated cues but we are sort of taking

450
00:30:46.239 --> 00:30:48.969
it all in, at the same time. I mean,

451
00:30:48.979 --> 00:30:53.719
it's like several different cues that we process very

452
00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:55.069
quickly. Right.

453
00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.030
Yeah. Yeah. So that's, uh, um, like, uh, you

454
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.800
know, the, of course, uh, the, the result of

455
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:07.729
uh this uh uh process is uh extremely impressive,

456
00:31:07.739 --> 00:31:11.189
as you said in the um in, in a

457
00:31:11.199 --> 00:31:16.410
few uh tens or hundreds of milliseconds. So we

458
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.881
are capable of, you know, not exactly exactly who

459
00:31:19.891 --> 00:31:22.651
you are, what you're doing and what's your relationship

460
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:24.952
with another? If you think about it, it's pretty

461
00:31:24.962 --> 00:31:29.572
impressive. Now, the question again is how the brain

462
00:31:29.781 --> 00:31:34.692
does it. So we are uh a little bit

463
00:31:34.702 --> 00:31:38.802
uh uh like farther away from an answer to

464
00:31:38.812 --> 00:31:42.212
this question for tourism. As I said, like we

465
00:31:42.222 --> 00:31:45.673
know a lot about face perception and body perception

466
00:31:45.683 --> 00:31:49.524
and biological motion perception. And that's a good basis

467
00:31:49.534 --> 00:31:52.203
I think to start this enterprise of, you know,

468
00:31:52.213 --> 00:31:59.134
understanding how we understand our complex social world. But

469
00:31:59.144 --> 00:32:02.854
uh um you know, there are questions that are

470
00:32:02.864 --> 00:32:06.875
because of course, understanding what the others are doing

471
00:32:06.885 --> 00:32:09.745
and how they relate to each other also requires

472
00:32:09.755 --> 00:32:13.076
to understand what they, what they have in mind,

473
00:32:13.086 --> 00:32:18.715
to understand their goals, their intention, their motivations and

474
00:32:18.725 --> 00:32:23.975
uh uh these, these questions fall under the big

475
00:32:23.985 --> 00:32:30.400
umbrella of social cognition, um social neuroscience. And uh

476
00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:35.420
this is a very young enterprise. We have begun

477
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.160
asking this question uh a few years ago and

478
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.750
uh there is a lot of effort and a

479
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:45.609
lot of energy, a lot of resources now that

480
00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:49.459
are dedicated to this kind of research, mostly because

481
00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:55.189
it's clear that uh um the society that we

482
00:32:55.199 --> 00:32:57.280
are building, that we have built and that we

483
00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:01.689
are building relies on our ability to manage people,

484
00:33:01.699 --> 00:33:05.239
to organize a group of people, to understand how

485
00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:09.089
people relate to each other. So to be able

486
00:33:09.099 --> 00:33:13.569
to sustain this kind of social environment that we

487
00:33:13.579 --> 00:33:17.170
live in, we have to understand as much as

488
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.609
we can about the human social brain. But uh

489
00:33:20.619 --> 00:33:24.630
again, this is a very young uh enterprise. And

490
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.369
so most of the questions are still open to,

491
00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.150
to discussion.

492
00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:33.260
Mhm Right. So, and since we're talking here also

493
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:37.109
about the brain, of course, um And we are

494
00:33:37.119 --> 00:33:43.380
referring mostly to spatial information, spatial cues, they are

495
00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.949
processed of course by the visual system. And is

496
00:33:46.959 --> 00:33:52.349
it the case that socially relevant spatial relations are

497
00:33:52.359 --> 00:33:59.969
represented visually differently than stimuli that are just unrelated

498
00:33:59.979 --> 00:34:02.770
or appear unrelated to one another?

499
00:34:04.189 --> 00:34:07.839
Yeah, absolutely. So this is basically the uh one

500
00:34:07.849 --> 00:34:11.320
of the main findings of our research in the,

501
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.760
in the recent years. Uh So, uh as I

502
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:17.850
said, we have first uh uh found uh uh

503
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.409
initial evidence in our, in our empirical data and

504
00:34:21.418 --> 00:34:27.530
our empirical results suggesting that uh uh facing individuals,

505
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.958
which is our, which is a proxy of social

506
00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:35.739
interacting individuals. So when I say facing, I'm implying

507
00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.350
that this positioning is somehow suggesting to our brain

508
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.708
that these two people are interacting. And this is

509
00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:46.658
why it's so important for our brain. So as

510
00:34:46.668 --> 00:34:49.319
I said, we have found that facing individuals are

511
00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:53.049
processed uh uh more efficiently than the very same

512
00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:58.729
individuals uh in, in a different special relation. And

513
00:34:58.739 --> 00:35:02.999
uh uh we have begun to show that uh

514
00:35:03.009 --> 00:35:08.118
the very specialized mechanism that uh we have learned

515
00:35:08.218 --> 00:35:14.889
to appreciate in perception, also apply to this configuration

516
00:35:14.899 --> 00:35:19.060
of seemingly interacting bodies, so face to face bodies.

517
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.719
And uh uh and then we have found that

518
00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:26.050
I use a lot of uh functional MRI, which

519
00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:31.010
is a neuroimaging methodology that allows to record the

520
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:35.090
brain at work while it's working. So to look

521
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.780
into the brain uh uh to measure the brain

522
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:44.060
activity during um any kind of cognitive task. And

523
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.840
uh so using F MRI, we have seen that

524
00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.530
visually in the visual areas. So in the areas

525
00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:55.919
dedicated to face body, biological motion perception, the very

526
00:35:55.929 --> 00:35:59.169
same bodies. So the two the two bodies, the

527
00:35:59.219 --> 00:36:03.820
very same bodies are processed differently when they are

528
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.659
face to face, relative to when they're back to

529
00:36:06.669 --> 00:36:12.229
back. And this is pretty impressive because uh so

530
00:36:12.239 --> 00:36:14.989
we just had a similar with the two bodies

531
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.169
either positioned face to face or identically just flipped

532
00:36:19.179 --> 00:36:21.709
so that they look back to back. So from

533
00:36:21.719 --> 00:36:26.479
a visual viewpoint, these two stimuli carry exactly the

534
00:36:26.489 --> 00:36:30.139
same information. The same amount of information is exactly

535
00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:33.222
the same number of pixels, the same body shapes,

536
00:36:33.232 --> 00:36:37.282
the same postures, the same color brightness, all the

537
00:36:37.292 --> 00:36:40.272
visual information that you think of. But just the

538
00:36:40.282 --> 00:36:44.062
fact that they are face to face, their positioning,

539
00:36:44.072 --> 00:36:46.353
to face each other or facing away from each

540
00:36:46.363 --> 00:36:51.492
other drives all kinds of different different effects in

541
00:36:51.502 --> 00:36:54.345
the visual cortex. So for instance, the visual cortex

542
00:36:54.355 --> 00:36:57.166
and in general, the level of activity in the

543
00:36:57.176 --> 00:37:02.045
areas for face and body perception is significantly higher.

544
00:37:02.125 --> 00:37:05.875
So the regions respond more when the bodies are

545
00:37:05.885 --> 00:37:08.476
face to face, relative to when the two people

546
00:37:08.486 --> 00:37:11.166
are back to back, which is already I think

547
00:37:11.176 --> 00:37:15.949
very interesting. But also, uh for instance, uh we

548
00:37:15.959 --> 00:37:21.530
have found using more sophisticated analytic methods uh on

549
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.830
uh uh uh F MRI data that uh the

550
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:30.530
representation of each individual body is more accurate. So

551
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:35.719
the brain represent each individual body better if the

552
00:37:35.729 --> 00:37:39.989
body appears in a relation in a social relation

553
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.709
with another than when the body is presented in

554
00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:47.850
isolation. So yeah, the the the short answer is

555
00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.709
that yes, there is something special and when I

556
00:37:50.719 --> 00:37:54.840
say special, I mean face like special in a

557
00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:58.070
sense. And so as I said repeatedly uh is

558
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.750
like a face perception is the gold standard of

559
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.239
the efficiency of human visual perception. And so what

560
00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:08.870
we see is that some of these very efficient

561
00:38:08.879 --> 00:38:14.120
mechanisms that we have evolved developed to process faces

562
00:38:14.129 --> 00:38:17.550
are used to process interacting people.

563
00:38:19.239 --> 00:38:23.159
And so still about perception that there's something very

564
00:38:23.169 --> 00:38:26.530
specific that I haven't asked you about yet. So

565
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:31.540
what is body form and body motion perception? And

566
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.709
in what ways exactly do these specific kinds of

567
00:38:34.719 --> 00:38:39.239
perception contribute to processing social events?

568
00:38:40.629 --> 00:38:44.080
So uh these are uh body but form and

569
00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:49.679
body motion are the two fundamental component of the

570
00:38:49.689 --> 00:38:54.199
visual system uses to build representation of an action.

571
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.939
So to understand another's action, so what another person

572
00:38:58.949 --> 00:39:01.129
for instance is doing but it is true also

573
00:39:01.139 --> 00:39:04.699
for the action of animals and also for the

574
00:39:04.899 --> 00:39:09.909
movements of objects we need to extract mentioned about

575
00:39:09.919 --> 00:39:13.399
their structure. So for instance, in the case of

576
00:39:13.409 --> 00:39:18.229
a person, um how the various body parts are

577
00:39:18.239 --> 00:39:21.310
positioning with respect to each other. So if the

578
00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:25.399
hand is here or here, this defines a different

579
00:39:25.409 --> 00:39:29.070
body posture, so a different body shape. So this

580
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.719
is the body form um information and then there

581
00:39:34.729 --> 00:39:38.760
is the other side that is the motion. So

582
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:44.260
how the position of each part changes from time

583
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:48.530
to time and this defines the motion pattern. So

584
00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.909
these are two different aspects that then they are

585
00:39:50.919 --> 00:39:54.350
integrated. So these are the body form and our

586
00:39:54.360 --> 00:40:00.129
body shape and the body motion uh are dissociated

587
00:40:00.139 --> 00:40:05.780
different uh different processes. Uh ALSO because they are

588
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:10.899
um uh implemented, they are computed in different parts

589
00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:13.790
in different brain regions. So we know that these

590
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.979
are two different aspects. But of course, the regions

591
00:40:16.989 --> 00:40:20.320
that care about the body motion and the regions

592
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:24.870
that care about body shape work uh in sync

593
00:40:24.879 --> 00:40:29.040
work really like in a close interaction with each

594
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.330
other. We say that they are functionally connected because

595
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.760
the information needs to be integrated to deliver the

596
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:40.870
representation of an action of an action, which is

597
00:40:40.879 --> 00:40:45.239
the beginning of the process for action understanding. So

598
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:49.159
we first need to understand the body posture, the

599
00:40:49.169 --> 00:40:52.709
body motion. And from there, we can start all

600
00:40:52.719 --> 00:40:57.439
the inferential processes that allow us to understand what

601
00:40:57.449 --> 00:41:00.790
the other, what the other's action goal is, uh

602
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.030
what the intention of the others are. And this,

603
00:41:04.239 --> 00:41:06.709
this is what we call the social inference.

604
00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:11.659
By the way body form and body motion perception

605
00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:16.830
are these in any way forms of embodied cognition.

606
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:22.739
So, um no, these are visual processes. So the

607
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.580
idea of embodied cognition, the general idea of embodied

608
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:29.199
cognition is that uh uh much of our cognitive

609
00:41:29.209 --> 00:41:34.620
life depends on our uh experience in the environment.

610
00:41:34.629 --> 00:41:38.135
So it's based on in particularly impact in particular

611
00:41:38.145 --> 00:41:42.155
our motor experience. So uh but when I talked

612
00:41:42.165 --> 00:41:45.524
about the body uh form and body motion, I

613
00:41:45.534 --> 00:41:49.584
was referring to visual processes like the processing tool

614
00:41:49.645 --> 00:41:54.574
to extract information uh from the physical structure of

615
00:41:54.584 --> 00:42:00.020
the of the of the input. Now does our

616
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:04.100
experience, our experience, our action, motor experience in the

617
00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:08.429
environment affects the way in which we process other

618
00:42:08.439 --> 00:42:12.899
actions and the social interactions. So we know that

619
00:42:12.909 --> 00:42:16.419
uh of course, like we uh we are in,

620
00:42:16.429 --> 00:42:20.939
we are in bodies like the brain is integrated

621
00:42:20.949 --> 00:42:23.689
in a body that has a certain type of

622
00:42:23.699 --> 00:42:27.239
experience. And the the way like our history of

623
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:31.550
interaction, the environment affects how we perceive other actions.

624
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:38.280
There is a very rich and complex literature on

625
00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:42.530
this, you know, relationship between action, understanding and the

626
00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:48.500
mo motor experience. We know much less about how

627
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:52.310
our experience of social interaction, so of interacting with

628
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.260
others affect the way in which we understand others,

629
00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:01.909
social interactions. I I think there is no, there

630
00:43:01.919 --> 00:43:05.139
is no really like a fully developed line of

631
00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:10.080
research yet on this. But uh you know, like

632
00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:13.800
uh uh there are a number of nontrivial questions

633
00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:16.360
to ask. For instance, the idea is that when

634
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:20.050
I observe and others perform another, performing an action

635
00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:23.110
in order to understand that's the basic idea of

636
00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.489
embodiment to understand what the other is doing. I

637
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:30.169
need to sort of use this as simulation process.

638
00:43:30.179 --> 00:43:33.679
I have to internally simulate the same action and

639
00:43:33.689 --> 00:43:36.139
this allows me to understand what the others is

640
00:43:36.149 --> 00:43:39.489
doing. But now in the context of social interaction,

641
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:43.520
I'm observing two people or more people interacting with

642
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:48.260
each other. So how does the motor simulation work

643
00:43:48.449 --> 00:43:52.669
like can we simulate multiple actions at the same

644
00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:55.580
time? So there are more people interacting. Our motor

645
00:43:55.639 --> 00:43:58.610
system is busy at you know, simulating all these

646
00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:02.229
actions like simultaneously. We are not sure the motor

647
00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:04.489
system can do it. We we are not sure

648
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.320
the motor system can hold the representation of multiple

649
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:12.530
motor programs at the same time. And uh oh

650
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.979
you know, we can think oh maybe the the

651
00:44:14.989 --> 00:44:18.219
the visual system selects the most important the more

652
00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:21.520
of two agents. And this is what it follows

653
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.409
that there is research that shows that we are

654
00:44:23.419 --> 00:44:26.320
very good at detecting in an interaction, who is

655
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:28.520
the agent and who is the patient. So who

656
00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:32.540
is the one who is acting on the other?

657
00:44:32.709 --> 00:44:35.290
And so maybe, and we know that um the

658
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:39.770
the system, the brain privileges information about agents. So

659
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.199
one possibility is that the motor simulation also privileges

660
00:44:44.389 --> 00:44:47.229
the simulation of the action of the person who

661
00:44:47.239 --> 00:44:49.770
is recognized as the agent. But again, these are

662
00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.889
all possible solutions. But uh we don't know the

663
00:44:52.899 --> 00:44:54.280
answer yet,

664
00:44:54.959 --> 00:45:01.100
but at least potentially there's some space for embodied

665
00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:02.419
cognition here.

666
00:45:03.229 --> 00:45:06.120
Oh, there is always a space for embodied cognition.

667
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:11.090
It's a, it's a um it's a very interesting

668
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:15.770
uh uh uh angle to look at how uh

669
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.610
human cognition in general, like by you know, relating

670
00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:21.919
the mind and the brain to the rest of

671
00:45:21.929 --> 00:45:25.360
the body. This is absolutely interesting because as I

672
00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:29.040
said cognition doesn't happen in a vacuum. We are

673
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.689
in a body and what happens to our body

674
00:45:31.699 --> 00:45:36.739
certainly affects our brain and our mind. But uh

675
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.649
I'm also, I also have a very critical view

676
00:45:39.659 --> 00:45:42.810
of embodied cognition because uh I think there are

677
00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:46.860
a lot of things, a lot of representations that

678
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:51.360
don't depend on motor experience on our experience are

679
00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:54.899
totally independent from the, from motor experience. And uh

680
00:45:54.909 --> 00:45:57.149
so sometimes I tend to be a little bit

681
00:45:57.159 --> 00:46:01.060
critical to the views that want to reduce the

682
00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:04.540
whole human cognition to motor experience.

683
00:46:04.959 --> 00:46:07.909
Mhm So now I have a couple of questions

684
00:46:07.919 --> 00:46:11.360
that I think you've already at least slightly touched

685
00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:15.439
on them earlier. But when it comes to social

686
00:46:15.449 --> 00:46:22.320
representations is the social entity itself as important as

687
00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:26.879
the relation that binds multiple entities together.

688
00:46:28.084 --> 00:46:31.895
So, yeah, um I think the relation is uh

689
00:46:31.905 --> 00:46:34.784
uh all that matters in uh in the social

690
00:46:34.794 --> 00:46:39.114
life uh in uh in for social cognition. And

691
00:46:39.125 --> 00:46:42.564
uh to the point that uh um when we

692
00:46:42.574 --> 00:46:45.814
see when we perceive a relation between the two

693
00:46:45.824 --> 00:46:50.574
social agents, between two people, uh we, the brain

694
00:46:50.584 --> 00:46:57.649
creates a whole new representation that uh has almost

695
00:46:57.659 --> 00:47:02.330
nothing to do with the two people itself. Like

696
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.840
what I mean? And we, we have, we have

697
00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:09.909
shown it uh uh really like empirically. So um

698
00:47:09.919 --> 00:47:15.270
when we see two objects, the neural response to

699
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.149
uh the two objects seen simultaneously is typically a

700
00:47:20.159 --> 00:47:24.389
linear combination of the response to the two single

701
00:47:24.399 --> 00:47:28.629
objects. So we can from, from the response to

702
00:47:28.639 --> 00:47:33.229
the two objects together, we can retrieve information about

703
00:47:33.239 --> 00:47:36.030
the two single object. Because the, the information about

704
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:40.689
the two single object is maintained in the representation

705
00:47:40.699 --> 00:47:44.590
of this composite representation that involves both objects. So

706
00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.510
if I see a pen and see if I

707
00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.040
see these two objects, and I measure the response

708
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.830
to this first in the brain. And then I

709
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.669
measure the response to this in the brain. And

710
00:47:55.679 --> 00:47:58.320
then I measure the response to them both presented

711
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:03.300
together. This response is typically an average of some

712
00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:06.159
linear combination of the response to the two single

713
00:48:06.169 --> 00:48:10.300
objects. But now what we see is that uh

714
00:48:10.699 --> 00:48:15.060
when uh we see two people and these two

715
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:20.600
people are represented in a social interaction, the response

716
00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:23.979
to these two people is a non linear combination

717
00:48:23.989 --> 00:48:27.909
of the response to each individual body presented in

718
00:48:27.919 --> 00:48:33.419
isolation. And this non linear combination of the response

719
00:48:33.429 --> 00:48:37.719
to the individuals is an indication that the brain

720
00:48:37.729 --> 00:48:42.439
is building a new representation that has almost nothing

721
00:48:42.449 --> 00:48:47.020
to do with the individuals. And this new representation

722
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.270
is basically the, the the the core input for

723
00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.760
the social cognition system. So yeah, the relation is

724
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:59.429
perhaps more important than the individuals themselves.

725
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:04.479
A and the relation is almost uh or perhaps

726
00:49:04.489 --> 00:49:08.379
it is even a different entity or a different

727
00:49:08.389 --> 00:49:12.449
kind of representation than the two individual people. And

728
00:49:12.459 --> 00:49:16.629
even the two individual people interacting with one another.

729
00:49:16.639 --> 00:49:19.399
I mean, it, it's a thing in and of

730
00:49:19.409 --> 00:49:20.000
itself.

731
00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.830
Right. Yes. Abso, that's, that's, again, that's, I was

732
00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.550
too uh enthusiastic in my. Yes. But uh that's

733
00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:31.010
my guess at the moment. Uh uh Yeah, it's

734
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:34.179
uh it's uh we have uh empirical data using

735
00:49:34.189 --> 00:49:40.500
F MRI using electroencephalography that uh um uh can

736
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:45.169
isolate this integrative response that suggests that the brain

737
00:49:45.179 --> 00:49:49.949
is transforming the input into into something that is

738
00:49:49.959 --> 00:49:52.270
a new thing that has nothing to do with

739
00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.540
the input itself. And we have seen this signature

740
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:58.189
of integration a lot when it comes to the

741
00:49:58.199 --> 00:50:01.179
perception of interact, social, interacting people.

742
00:50:02.169 --> 00:50:04.389
And when it comes to the brain, do we

743
00:50:04.399 --> 00:50:11.169
know if there's actually visual specialization for diab human

744
00:50:11.179 --> 00:50:14.669
human interactions? I mean is there a specialization for

745
00:50:14.679 --> 00:50:16.929
that specifically or

746
00:50:16.939 --> 00:50:20.610
not? Yeah, absolutely. As I said, we have recorded

747
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.810
using F MRI, we have recorded from visual cortex,

748
00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.459
from visual regions and we have seen that there

749
00:50:26.469 --> 00:50:30.191
are some very similar active parts of the visual

750
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:35.221
system that seems to like facing diets more than

751
00:50:35.231 --> 00:50:39.791
anything else. So this is already one signature of

752
00:50:39.802 --> 00:50:43.961
specialization we have seen even in behavioral task like

753
00:50:43.971 --> 00:50:50.312
if we present stimuli around the perceptual threshold. So

754
00:50:50.322 --> 00:50:53.072
in very low visibility conditions, so we are used

755
00:50:53.082 --> 00:50:56.674
to do this experiment to isolate the limits of

756
00:50:56.684 --> 00:50:59.874
visual perception. And so we present a stimuli, for

757
00:50:59.884 --> 00:51:04.694
instance, low contrast stimuli very rapidly to the subject

758
00:51:04.704 --> 00:51:06.763
and the subject have to report whether they have

759
00:51:06.773 --> 00:51:10.253
seen a stimulus or not. And we see that

760
00:51:10.293 --> 00:51:13.733
and this is one of the ways to measure

761
00:51:13.743 --> 00:51:17.694
the efficiency of in the perception of a given

762
00:51:17.704 --> 00:51:21.533
type of stimuli. And what we see is that

763
00:51:21.543 --> 00:51:25.835
again, when we present these facing bodies, the system

764
00:51:25.845 --> 00:51:29.516
is much faster. So the responses are much faster

765
00:51:29.545 --> 00:51:32.936
and much more accurate than when present bodies in

766
00:51:32.946 --> 00:51:37.416
isolation or in other kinds of special relations. So

767
00:51:37.426 --> 00:51:41.006
we have a behavioral, we have F MRI, we

768
00:51:41.016 --> 00:51:47.105
have ee electroencephalographic signature of that suggests that there

769
00:51:47.115 --> 00:51:53.419
is a visual specialization for uh fishing diets. And

770
00:51:53.429 --> 00:51:58.419
uh visual specialization means that uh we just have

771
00:51:58.449 --> 00:52:02.899
uh uh very efficient mechanisms to detect this kind

772
00:52:02.909 --> 00:52:06.010
of configuration in the space. So for instance, if

773
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.310
I present subjects with very clot, the rich and

774
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.939
noisy visual scene that has a tool facing people

775
00:52:14.949 --> 00:52:18.699
somewhere in this scene, we have seen that subjects

776
00:52:18.709 --> 00:52:23.790
immediately find these stimulus in the in the clutter.

777
00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.770
And this is again another signature of the visual

778
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:28.540
efficiency.

779
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:32.870
So earlier, we've talked about the kinds of cues

780
00:52:32.879 --> 00:52:36.739
that people process in looking at the social scene

781
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:39.929
and interpreting it as for example, when looking at

782
00:52:39.939 --> 00:52:44.459
the diet of people as interacting or non interacting.

783
00:52:44.469 --> 00:52:49.290
But how do we go from spatial relations between

784
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.729
people to uh perhaps trying to extract some information

785
00:52:53.739 --> 00:52:57.149
about the kind of relationship they have with one

786
00:52:57.159 --> 00:53:02.159
another and how much information can we extract from

787
00:53:02.169 --> 00:53:03.370
them uh about that.

788
00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:06.989
So, as I said, unfortunately, I cannot give you

789
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.729
an answer about how, because we are just at

790
00:53:10.739 --> 00:53:13.729
the beginning of this enterprise. So maybe in a

791
00:53:13.739 --> 00:53:16.419
few years, we'll be able to know how we

792
00:53:16.429 --> 00:53:19.620
go from, you know, putting together. So the visual

793
00:53:19.629 --> 00:53:23.040
system knows that the two people are face to

794
00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:27.590
face, they are closing space, they are touching each

795
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.304
other, maybe uh they are, they have outstretched limbs

796
00:53:31.314 --> 00:53:33.824
toward each other. So they have all these features.

797
00:53:33.834 --> 00:53:39.104
So immediately the visual system um uh represents OK,

798
00:53:39.114 --> 00:53:42.584
this might be a social interaction. And so this

799
00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:47.254
information package is put is sent into the, you

800
00:53:47.264 --> 00:53:50.554
know, high level networks for social inference, the so

801
00:53:50.564 --> 00:53:55.620
called social brain network. And from here, how do

802
00:53:55.629 --> 00:53:59.389
we come to understand for instance that these two

803
00:53:59.399 --> 00:54:06.540
people are two lovers, for instance, or our two

804
00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:12.120
enemies are competing? It's less clear what I can

805
00:54:12.129 --> 00:54:16.399
say is that again, we are very sensitive to

806
00:54:16.409 --> 00:54:21.256
small v in the spatial temporal patterns. So for

807
00:54:21.266 --> 00:54:25.466
instance, the way in which one object moves with

808
00:54:25.476 --> 00:54:31.246
respect to another can be immediately interpreted as having

809
00:54:31.805 --> 00:54:36.426
a positive or negative intention. So and you know,

810
00:54:36.436 --> 00:54:40.125
if you just a small acceleration in the movement

811
00:54:40.135 --> 00:54:43.961
of an object relative to another object can suggest

812
00:54:43.971 --> 00:54:47.312
that one is chasing the other or that the

813
00:54:47.322 --> 00:54:50.832
one. So it's one that is chasing the other

814
00:54:50.842 --> 00:54:53.922
or that the other is escaping from the other

815
00:54:53.991 --> 00:54:57.892
like in small variation in the acceleration, for instance,

816
00:54:57.902 --> 00:55:02.892
can give a completely different cognitive representation, mental representation

817
00:55:02.931 --> 00:55:08.000
of what we see. But again, the computational uh

818
00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:13.020
machinery that does this from, you know, seeing bodies

819
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:19.379
faces facing each other, especially close to understand the

820
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:23.620
the rich nature of a social interaction. That's really

821
00:55:23.629 --> 00:55:24.600
an open question.

822
00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:28.629
And do we have a good idea of what

823
00:55:28.639 --> 00:55:31.649
of what are the areas of the brain that

824
00:55:31.659 --> 00:55:35.939
are part of the network that that processes processes

825
00:55:35.949 --> 00:55:37.149
social information.

826
00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:42.860
Yeah, I mean, we do. Um SO definitely there

827
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:46.389
is a uh an important contribution of visual areas.

828
00:55:46.399 --> 00:55:48.820
As I said, we have been discussing this so

829
00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:52.239
far, like uh visual areas, extract of a lot,

830
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:55.919
a lot of of useful information for social inference.

831
00:55:56.439 --> 00:56:01.370
And um and uh I I'd say that uh

832
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:05.540
because of the importance of uh the social life

833
00:56:05.550 --> 00:56:08.629
from our survival, we have developed a number of

834
00:56:08.639 --> 00:56:12.199
very efficient mechanisms to do so. So visual mechanism

835
00:56:12.209 --> 00:56:17.719
dedicated to uh extract the socially radical information. But

836
00:56:17.729 --> 00:56:20.979
then uh uh outside the the visual system, the

837
00:56:20.989 --> 00:56:24.919
visual system is just the entry of the information

838
00:56:24.929 --> 00:56:28.080
in the brain and outside of the visual information

839
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:30.550
in the brain. But then outside the visual system,

840
00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:33.179
there, there is no one network, there are many

841
00:56:33.189 --> 00:56:38.419
networks that uh uh implement processes that are relevant

842
00:56:38.429 --> 00:56:42.739
for uh social cognition. For instance, the action understanding

843
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:46.114
network is the network dedicated it one and the

844
00:56:46.125 --> 00:56:51.264
action and what understanding and action means means, understand

845
00:56:51.274 --> 00:56:56.334
the goals and intentions of an action. There is

846
00:56:56.344 --> 00:57:00.155
uh the, the mind or the mentalis network, which

847
00:57:00.165 --> 00:57:03.395
is another set of regions that is dedicated to

848
00:57:03.405 --> 00:57:06.574
what we call mind reading, what's in another mind,

849
00:57:06.584 --> 00:57:09.225
what the others are thinking also, we are very

850
00:57:09.235 --> 00:57:12.885
good at that and we don't know how that

851
00:57:12.895 --> 00:57:17.219
happens. And um and uh uh then there is,

852
00:57:17.229 --> 00:57:20.540
of course, the semantic system, the conceptual system that

853
00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:24.060
represent all the knowledge that we have about the

854
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:28.439
others. And in particular, the social knowledge seems to

855
00:57:28.449 --> 00:57:31.239
be a very specific type of knowledge that is

856
00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:36.520
represented probably in dedicated part of the larger semantic

857
00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:39.760
system. So yeah, uh what we need to understand

858
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:44.000
is really the specific computation in each of these

859
00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:48.239
regions and also how the information travels within these

860
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:52.149
networks and how this network uh networks interact with

861
00:57:52.159 --> 00:57:55.030
each other. Let me just add the la last

862
00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:00.229
thing uh I talked a lot about visual information,

863
00:58:00.239 --> 00:58:03.699
socially relevant visual information because that's what I study.

864
00:58:03.939 --> 00:58:05.699
But you know, there is there, there is not

865
00:58:05.709 --> 00:58:10.340
just vision, there are other sensory modalities and the

866
00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:13.959
other sensory modalities carry also a lot of relevant

867
00:58:13.969 --> 00:58:18.870
information for social cognition. Uh As we talked about

868
00:58:18.879 --> 00:58:22.360
briefly about the speech, the acoustic signal, there's nothing

869
00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:27.435
more social speech. And uh the smell is another

870
00:58:27.524 --> 00:58:31.594
um field that uh is um uh is is

871
00:58:31.604 --> 00:58:36.314
receiving a lot of attention uh because it's probably

872
00:58:36.324 --> 00:58:41.764
one of the fundamental uh uh foundations of it

873
00:58:41.774 --> 00:58:47.594
provides some foundations to uh social relationships. So it's

874
00:58:47.604 --> 00:58:49.715
um it's a, it's a long, it's gonna be

875
00:58:49.725 --> 00:58:50.705
a long way.

876
00:58:51.479 --> 00:58:54.659
Yeah, of course, it's important to mention that, that

877
00:58:54.669 --> 00:59:00.679
we here today were we were focusing on spatial

878
00:59:00.689 --> 00:59:05.260
relations and on visual information because that's the main

879
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:08.429
focus of your research. But of course, we do

880
00:59:08.439 --> 00:59:13.300
not only process visual information but also information from

881
00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:16.820
the other senses when interacting with other people.

882
00:59:17.615 --> 00:59:20.746
It's important to, to, to, to say so, so

883
00:59:20.756 --> 00:59:23.466
not just because it's fair for our colleagues who

884
00:59:23.476 --> 00:59:26.256
don't study vision, but also because uh vision is

885
00:59:26.266 --> 00:59:30.476
one of the most if not the most studied

886
00:59:30.486 --> 00:59:35.996
aspect of the human brain. Uh And some believe

887
00:59:36.006 --> 00:59:40.246
that vision is also the main sensory modality for

888
00:59:40.256 --> 00:59:44.102
humans. Uh Some agree, some don't agree with that,

889
00:59:44.112 --> 00:59:46.402
but it's true that we are, we have a

890
00:59:46.501 --> 00:59:50.572
representation of the brain that is very much centered

891
00:59:50.582 --> 00:59:54.501
on visual processing. But it's uh it's uh it's

892
00:59:54.511 --> 00:59:57.291
fair to acknowledge that, you know, there are other

893
00:59:57.302 --> 01:00:02.382
important modalities and in fields of research that needs

894
01:00:02.392 --> 01:00:03.652
to be acknowledged.

895
01:00:03.981 --> 01:00:08.021
Of course. So let's get into our last topic

896
01:00:08.031 --> 01:00:13.320
slash questions. So we've been focusing on humans here.

897
01:00:13.469 --> 01:00:17.360
But what about the nonhuman animals? Because I mean,

898
01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:20.669
we as people, I guess that we also look

899
01:00:20.679 --> 01:00:26.679
at the spatial relations, body configurations of other animals.

900
01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:30.520
And for example, there are some biped animals and

901
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:35.179
some quadrupeds as well. So do we distinguish in

902
01:00:35.189 --> 01:00:39.959
specific ways between those two? And how does that

903
01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:43.580
work? Uh ON the level of the brain neurologically?

904
01:00:44.729 --> 01:00:46.780
So there are two aspects of this research. I'm

905
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:49.949
trying to answer them both. The first one is

906
01:00:49.959 --> 01:00:53.689
uh our perception of other animals that are nonhumans.

907
01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:58.560
Uh So, um uh the mechanism that I described

908
01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:01.110
the first general answer to the question is that

909
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.320
all the mechanism that I described so far uh

910
01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:09.854
like this ability to process phases, biological motion bodies.

911
01:01:09.864 --> 01:01:13.104
So this is why I talk about faces, biological

912
01:01:13.114 --> 01:01:18.794
motion, bodies, bodies and not human bodies, not human

913
01:01:18.804 --> 01:01:23.945
faces, non human motion, because these especially individual cortex,

914
01:01:23.955 --> 01:01:26.955
the regions that cares about this, that care about

915
01:01:26.965 --> 01:01:32.550
this important aspect of the social life, recognizing faces,

916
01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:40.729
bodies, motion um operate over uh any animate entity.

917
01:01:40.889 --> 01:01:44.260
So they don't seem to care much whether a

918
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:48.199
face is a human face or a monkey face.

919
01:01:48.209 --> 01:01:51.070
For instance, the fusiform face area, which is the

920
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.415
region that responds to phases that has this very

921
01:01:54.425 --> 01:01:59.435
strong selective response to phases, doesn't show very reliable

922
01:01:59.445 --> 01:02:03.574
difference between a human face and a monkey phase

923
01:02:03.584 --> 01:02:06.824
or a cat phase. And the same is for

924
01:02:06.834 --> 01:02:14.094
the regions that process motion, they process biological motion.

925
01:02:14.104 --> 01:02:16.814
So any kind of motion that looks like the

926
01:02:16.824 --> 01:02:21.764
property of a biological motion relative to mechanic motion.

927
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:26.969
But uh uh they don't have much uh you

928
01:02:26.979 --> 01:02:30.320
know, fine uh fine grain distinctions in terms of,

929
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.530
you know, uh the the species that is uh

930
01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.739
moving, whether it's a human or not. So, you

931
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:39.879
know, uh one line of research, we really asked

932
01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:43.629
the question, whether the visual system really doesn't help

933
01:02:43.639 --> 01:02:46.280
at all in the distinction between a human and

934
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.020
nonhuman animals, which is very important us, I mean,

935
01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:53.090
we need to know whether and animating is a

936
01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:56.770
human is a conspecific or not. And we were

937
01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.550
very, I was very particularly surprised by the research

938
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.929
on biological motion because it was a little bit

939
01:03:02.939 --> 01:03:06.310
confusing, like most of the field was talking about

940
01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.620
biological motion, but some authors were talking about, you

941
01:03:10.629 --> 01:03:15.090
know, these regions being tuned to human motion. So

942
01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.320
I wanted to see whether they are really tuned

943
01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:19.790
to human motion, which means that these regions are

944
01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.760
capable of distinguishing what is human from what is

945
01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:26.250
non human. Or in fact, they are picking up

946
01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:30.600
some feature in the motion that is typical of

947
01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:34.604
humans, but they don't really what is a human

948
01:03:34.614 --> 01:03:37.235
and what is a nonhuman thing. So the intuition,

949
01:03:37.245 --> 01:03:39.695
the idea that we had was OK, we can

950
01:03:39.705 --> 01:03:45.604
uh uh present videos of uh uh four kind

951
01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:50.895
of animate entities. A walking man, just a human

952
01:03:50.905 --> 01:03:56.729
who walks another human, a baby crawling uh cat,

953
01:03:57.100 --> 01:04:02.620
pa four legs crawling and uh a cat is

954
01:04:02.629 --> 01:04:07.270
a nonhuman which also walks uh uh with, with

955
01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.850
four legs and a cheek. A chika is a

956
01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:16.260
non human but like the prototypical human walks with

957
01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:19.429
two legs. So we wanted to see whether the

958
01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:23.360
regions in the visual cortex that care about motion

959
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:27.719
could really distinguish human from no human. In which

960
01:04:27.729 --> 01:04:30.360
case we should, we should, we should see that

961
01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:34.080
response to the man and the baby is more

962
01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:36.679
similar than the response to the cat and the

963
01:04:36.689 --> 01:04:42.370
chicken or they are not really human uh preferring

964
01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:45.409
regions, but they actually only care about motion. And

965
01:04:45.419 --> 01:04:47.610
so what they can distinguish is the kind of

966
01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.520
motion and they don't care whether it's a human

967
01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:52.189
or nonhuman. And because there are these two big

968
01:04:52.199 --> 01:04:55.899
categories of motion, bipedal motion, which is typical of

969
01:04:55.909 --> 01:04:58.590
the human species, but not only of the human

970
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:03.669
species and quadrupedal motion. We predicted that if these

971
01:05:03.679 --> 01:05:06.425
regions are only about the kind of motion, we

972
01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:09.225
should find that the response to the man is

973
01:05:09.235 --> 01:05:11.814
more similar to the response to the cheek because

974
01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:14.824
they are both bipedal and the response to the

975
01:05:14.834 --> 01:05:18.574
cat is more similar to the neural response to

976
01:05:18.584 --> 01:05:21.395
the baby because these are two quadrupeds, they are

977
01:05:21.405 --> 01:05:24.935
moving with four legs and this is exactly what

978
01:05:24.945 --> 01:05:28.625
we found. So this means that yes, what what

979
01:05:28.635 --> 01:05:32.544
this means is that yes, the visual system uh

980
01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:37.260
is capable of making distinctions a subtle distinction. In

981
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:40.330
this case, in the type of motion, which might

982
01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.350
be useful then to distinguish what is a human

983
01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:49.679
from a nonhuman, but they are not yet representations

984
01:05:49.689 --> 01:05:53.800
of humanness, the visual system doesn't seem to care

985
01:05:53.810 --> 01:06:00.500
much about humanness, it cares about animated things, animals,

986
01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:07.330
whatever is a biological entity. Of course, you can

987
01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:10.360
find the differences. Uh FOR instance, uh because, you

988
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:12.709
know, I don't wanna, you know, his colleagues to

989
01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:15.110
jump and say no, but uh also, you know,

990
01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:19.489
like uh the response to human faces, individual system

991
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.729
is stronger. But then it becomes hard to know

992
01:06:22.739 --> 01:06:25.169
whether it is just an effect of familiarity because

993
01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:28.020
we see a lot of human faces and we

994
01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:30.870
have seen very few monkey faces in our life.

995
01:06:30.879 --> 01:06:33.590
So you can pick up this difference due to

996
01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.010
the familiarity of the stimulus to which the visual

997
01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:40.909
system is very sensitive. But it doesn't mean that

998
01:06:40.919 --> 01:06:44.209
uh uh intrinsically the visual system care about the

999
01:06:44.219 --> 01:06:45.709
human on human distinction.

1000
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.159
Uh And I guess that uh one very interesting

1001
01:06:50.169 --> 01:06:55.300
thing about studying these, about the brain processes, information,

1002
01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:59.689
I mean motion information and spatial uh uh and

1003
01:06:59.699 --> 01:07:02.879
the information about the body and spatial relationship uh

1004
01:07:02.889 --> 01:07:07.909
relations between humans and nonhumans is that this also

1005
01:07:07.919 --> 01:07:13.120
might also inform us about if about whether specific

1006
01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:18.346
areas of the brain specialized for processing human related

1007
01:07:18.356 --> 01:07:23.106
information or if they are perhaps more domain general

1008
01:07:23.116 --> 01:07:27.427
and they are specialized just for motion or for

1009
01:07:27.437 --> 01:07:32.106
particular body configurations or something like that. Right.

1010
01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:35.386
Yeah. So the kind of manipulation that I described

1011
01:07:35.396 --> 01:07:39.257
where we manipulated the motion in the bipedal versus

1012
01:07:39.267 --> 01:07:42.934
quadrupedal human versus non human is one example of

1013
01:07:42.944 --> 01:07:45.273
the kind of manipulation that we do. And this

1014
01:07:45.283 --> 01:07:48.303
is why it's fun to be an experimentalist because

1015
01:07:48.313 --> 01:07:50.303
you know, we have the brain and the brain

1016
01:07:50.313 --> 01:07:53.813
activity, but then we have to read the information

1017
01:07:53.823 --> 01:07:56.033
in that activity. So we can use this kind

1018
01:07:56.043 --> 01:07:59.424
of manipulation to see. OK, what's in that activity?

1019
01:07:59.434 --> 01:08:02.843
What's information in that activity is information about the

1020
01:08:02.854 --> 01:08:06.803
species a human versus non human is information about

1021
01:08:06.884 --> 01:08:11.200
uh uh motion. So by pedal versus quadrupedal. And

1022
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:14.081
so in this way, exactly with this manipulation, we

1023
01:08:14.091 --> 01:08:16.720
found that in fact, these regions in the visual

1024
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:20.189
cortex really care about motion. That's all they care

1025
01:08:20.201 --> 01:08:24.041
about. But there are other regions in a higher

1026
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:30.840
level in higher order systems that uh instead begin

1027
01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:33.210
to make the distinction between a human and a

1028
01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:37.081
human because our cognition needs to make that distinction.

1029
01:08:38.559 --> 01:08:42.818
Great. So, uh Doctor Pape, just before we go,

1030
01:08:42.828 --> 01:08:44.898
would you like to tell people where they can

1031
01:08:44.908 --> 01:08:47.618
find you and your work on the internet?

1032
01:08:48.609 --> 01:08:52.500
Yes. So I have a website, a personal website

1033
01:08:52.509 --> 01:08:56.250
uh uh V uh uh sorry dot I'm learning

1034
01:08:56.259 --> 01:08:57.430
French. So it's

1035
01:08:57.439 --> 01:08:58.479
like that's

1036
01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:03.330
OK. It's, it's terrible. So VVV uh dot Lua

1037
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:09.990
pao.com, I'm also active on Twitter as a Ya

1038
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.679
um P. Uh uh I have recently joined this

1039
01:09:14.688 --> 01:09:19.999
uh Blue Sky uh platform now website, uh which

1040
01:09:20.008 --> 01:09:22.408
