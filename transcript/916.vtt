00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.500
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:04.809
day host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm joined by

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.900
Doctor Christian Hart. He is a professor of Psychology

4
00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:11.630
at Texas Women's University where he is the Director

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.119
of the Psychological Science Program, as well as the

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.250
director of the Human Deception Laboratory. His research explores

7
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.829
the behavioral cues of deception, pathological, lying, lying within

8
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.059
relationships, lying, morality and the factors that influence decisions

9
00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:30.440
to be honest or deceptive. And today we are

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.139
focusing mostly on his two books, Pathological Lying Theory,

11
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.409
Research and Practice and his latest one, big liars.

12
00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:43.020
What psychological science tells us about lying and how

13
00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:46.380
you can avoid being duped. So Dr Hart, welcome

14
00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:48.340
to the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

15
00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:51.630
Uh Thanks for having me, Ricardo. It's a great

16
00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.250
pleasure for me to be here. I'm a big

17
00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:54.500
fan of your podcast.

18
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.189
Well, thank you so much. So, get, let's get

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.450
right into it. And I would like to start

20
00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:04.480
perhaps with a basic question. So what is a

21
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.569
lie exactly? I mean, since you approach, I guess

22
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.514
lying and honesty from a psychological viewpoint, uh what

23
00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:17.275
counts really as a lie here. Uh

24
00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:22.125
WE define lying as a, a communication that's intended

25
00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:25.694
to convince someone of something that we know is

26
00:01:25.705 --> 00:01:29.635
untrue. So, and, and, and when I say communication,

27
00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:32.434
we, we usually mean uh the spoken word but

28
00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:36.449
also obviously the written word. Um BUT we also

29
00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:42.019
communicate using gestures and using silence. Um So any

30
00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:46.779
uh natural communication that's that we use to try

31
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.279
to impart um some information on someone else that

32
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.120
we know to be untrue.

33
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.669
And do we know before we get into lying

34
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.230
itself, do we have good enough data to tell

35
00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:04.519
how honest people are in general or not?

36
00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:09.508
Well, the way that we study dishonesty and lying

37
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.210
is, um, is primarily through self report. So we

38
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.470
ask people and, you know, there's the inherent problem

39
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.770
in there when we're asking people to self report

40
00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.729
about their behavior. Are they giving us accurate information,

41
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.600
especially on a topic like dishonesty? And so we,

42
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.839
we try to, um, you know, set the stage,

43
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.160
uh, such that people will be, um, straightforward when

44
00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.100
they're telling us about their patterns of lying. And

45
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.360
one of the ways we do that is we,

46
00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.320
um, have them give us that information anonymously. So

47
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.089
typically through anonymous online surveys. So there's no one

48
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.539
judging them. So there's no real incentive to, to,

49
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.360
um, to be dishonest. Uh, WE also normalize lying

50
00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:59.300
like we'll usually, uh, set the stage by, by

51
00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:04.080
telling people, most people lie fairly regularly. Uh, ALMOST

52
00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:07.220
everyone lies at some point. And so now we

53
00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.610
want to know about your patterns of lying and,

54
00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:13.369
and we, we have some evidence that when people

55
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.850
self report about their lying, they're actually giving us

56
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.869
accurate information because uh you know, there are, there

57
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.369
are uh experimental techniques where we could ask people

58
00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:25.929
whether they lie a little or lie a lot

59
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.429
and they'll tell us and, and then we can

60
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.889
bring them into the laboratory and set up contrived

61
00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:35.270
situations where they can, um, either be honest or

62
00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:38.699
they can lie for a financial reward. And what

63
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.539
we find is people who say I tend to

64
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.110
lie a lot. They tend to actually lie in

65
00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.179
those laboratory situations. And then people who say they're

66
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.059
particularly honest tend not to lie in those situations.

67
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.770
So we have some validity checks that suggest those,

68
00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:55.259
uh, self report measures are, are probably fairly accurate.

69
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.580
Mhm. So, I would imagine that pretty much everyone

70
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.029
lies some of the time and, and I'm not

71
00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:08.339
saying I'm not talking here about big massive deceptions

72
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.800
or anything like that. I mean, it's mostly, I

73
00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:15.509
would imagine like small white lies that don't cause

74
00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:18.475
damage at all, I would imagine. But let me

75
00:04:18.483 --> 00:04:21.803
actually ask you about that. So, should we, first

76
00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:24.595
of all, should we expect the people to be

77
00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:28.255
honest most of the time? And when they are

78
00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:30.894
dishonest? I mean, what are some of the most

79
00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:34.795
common ways people lie? Really?

80
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.450
Yeah. And so we, we do find that most

81
00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:41.369
people are mostly on most of the time. And

82
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.309
so, one of the ways that, that we assess

83
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.130
lying in, in our laboratory is we, we ask

84
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.059
people, how many lies have you told in the

85
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.089
past 24 hours? And the majority of people say

86
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.250
zero and, and of those people who say they

87
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.279
have told a lie, it tends to be pretty

88
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.429
minimal, one lie or two lies. Um But we

89
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.779
do have this subset of people that, that lie

90
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.700
and extraordinarily uh lie extraordinarily uh frequently. Um And

91
00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:14.769
when we look at why people lie, you're right.

92
00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.429
You know, these tend not to be big lies.

93
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.559
Most of the uh reasons that people give for

94
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.100
lying are to avoid shame and embarrassment. So they're

95
00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:31.779
lying to save face essentially. And um and, and

96
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.339
so people's deception tends not to be malicious. Uh

97
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.309
uh Most of the lying tends to be uh

98
00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:44.980
protecting themselves and people lie for privacy sake. Um

99
00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:48.239
People also tell lies just to smooth over social

100
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.880
interactions. And so, you know, when I come into

101
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.790
the office and one of my colleagues says, how

102
00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:55.820
are you doing today? Even if I'm not doing

103
00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:59.299
that that great, I'll say I'm doing fine. And

104
00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:01.380
it's because neither of us wants to have a

105
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.750
difficult conversation about my personal life struggles at that

106
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.179
moment. You know, so we, we tell these uh

107
00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:12.579
these lies pretty regularly just to allow uh social

108
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:14.540
interactions to proceed smoothly

109
00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:17.899
and I might be wrong here. But isn't it

110
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.540
also the case that uh a big chunk of

111
00:06:21.549 --> 00:06:25.019
the time when we lie? It's not actually uh

112
00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:29.420
uh really a straight uh straight out lying but

113
00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:34.510
mostly like omitting some information that people do not

114
00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:38.250
ask us directly. But perhaps we might think. Oh,

115
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.140
ok. So perhaps if I were 100% honest, I

116
00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:45.309
should also make deciding not to do that something

117
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.540
like that. Right.

118
00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:50.609
Yeah, that's, that's what we find is that, um,

119
00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:54.859
if most people wanna avoid giving honest answers, they

120
00:06:54.869 --> 00:07:00.100
will use the most morally defensible strategy possible. And,

121
00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:01.850
and the, the, the easiest one is just to

122
00:07:01.859 --> 00:07:05.690
avoid a topic entirely so different, then I don't

123
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.010
need to talk to you about these, uh, unpleasant

124
00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:11.010
things that I don't wanna, um, that I don't

125
00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:15.420
wanna discuss other ways that, that we can answer

126
00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:20.540
or respond dishonestly is by minimizing, um, by using

127
00:07:20.549 --> 00:07:24.570
vague language. And so most people will only use

128
00:07:24.579 --> 00:07:27.820
an outright lie as is the, the strategy of

129
00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:32.019
last resort because an outright lie is in most

130
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:35.339
people's minds kind of morally indefensible. If you're caught

131
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.619
in a lie, it, it, it has some big,

132
00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:42.869
um, social repercussions and reputational repercussions. And so most

133
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.720
of us will try to, um, find these, uh,

134
00:07:45.769 --> 00:07:51.630
uh, less grievous, uh, uh, strategies for being dishonest.

135
00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:56.000
Yeah. Basically some small ways of circumventing, uh, total

136
00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:01.440
honesty. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Ok. So, a and using

137
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.899
or referring to the title of one of your

138
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.559
books, the most recent one. Who are these big

139
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.399
liars, what characterizes them?

140
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:15.600
Well, when we, we've studied thousands of people in

141
00:08:15.609 --> 00:08:18.320
our studies and what we find consistently, as I

142
00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:20.890
mentioned earlier is most people are pretty honest, but

143
00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:26.450
there's this small subset that, that lies um extraordinarily.

144
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.269
And so when we're talking about big liars in

145
00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:32.830
the book, we talk about really kind of two

146
00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:37.770
groups of people, people who lie very frequently. Um

147
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.700
But also um people who tell maybe fewer lies

148
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:46.289
but lies that have massive consequences. And so when

149
00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:48.809
we look at the types of people who tend

150
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.760
to lie very frequently, we see some patterns. Um

151
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.000
ONE is they turn um lying kind of peaks

152
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.530
in late adolescence for most people and then declines

153
00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:02.900
across adulthood. And so younger people tend to lie

154
00:09:03.179 --> 00:09:06.549
more than older people. Um We've looked at gender

155
00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:09.440
differences and what we find is that men and

156
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.849
women don't really lie differentially as far as frequency,

157
00:09:13.859 --> 00:09:16.000
men. I mean, there's a slight difference but it's,

158
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.039
it's like 4% difference. It's pretty uh minor. But

159
00:09:20.049 --> 00:09:21.880
when we look at people who lie a lot,

160
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.570
it's predominantly men. And so when we look at

161
00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.260
those people who probably, you know, 10 or more

162
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.690
lies a day, uh the men, uh definitely outnumber

163
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.409
um the women. And then there's other patterns that

164
00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:40.429
we see um in personality traits. For example, we

165
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.020
see that um, self esteem is associated with lying.

166
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.940
So people with low self esteem tend to lie

167
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.590
considerably more than people with higher self esteem. And

168
00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:52.869
that kind of tracks with, um, you know, some

169
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.919
of the things I was talking about earlier is

170
00:09:54.929 --> 00:09:57.549
people often lie out of a sense of shame

171
00:09:57.559 --> 00:10:01.229
or embarrassment, things like that. Um And then we

172
00:10:01.239 --> 00:10:04.719
also see some personality traits like the the dark

173
00:10:04.729 --> 00:10:10.429
triad personality traits like Machiavellian is and, and psychopathy.

174
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.229
So people who are kind of generally kind of

175
00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:16.780
nasty, manipulative people use dishonesty, um, more often than

176
00:10:16.789 --> 00:10:20.380
people who don't, uh, have those personality traits. And

177
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.210
then, you know, so, so those are some of

178
00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:25.409
the factors that are associated with being, uh, prolific

179
00:10:25.419 --> 00:10:26.719
liars or big liars.

180
00:10:27.349 --> 00:10:31.299
Ok. So let's go through some of the differences

181
00:10:31.309 --> 00:10:34.549
there, break them down a little bit further. So,

182
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.270
uh, you mentioned there, for example that, uh, generally

183
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.500
speaking, there's not a big difference in the rates

184
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.760
of lying between men and women, but among the

185
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.489
big liars, most of them seem to be male.

186
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.169
So, is there any explanation to for that?

187
00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:57.609
Well, when we, uh, when we look at, um,

188
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.950
how some of these big liars operate, some of

189
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.039
them are, um, more, uh, manipulative and they will

190
00:11:05.049 --> 00:11:09.299
kind of callously take advantage of others. And those

191
00:11:09.309 --> 00:11:12.380
traits are, are much more common in men than

192
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:15.789
they are in women. Um, SORT of status seeking

193
00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:19.549
is much higher in males um, and so it's,

194
00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:22.789
it's possible that those are actually the underlying traits

195
00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:25.570
that are, uh, more related to the lying rather

196
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.500
than the, you know, the biological sex itself. It's

197
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.099
these, um, these traits that probably are to a

198
00:11:32.109 --> 00:11:35.250
certain degree socialized and probably to a certain degree,

199
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.590
there's something, you know, different in our underlying biology

200
00:11:38.599 --> 00:11:42.280
that gives rise to these traits where males, more

201
00:11:42.289 --> 00:11:46.140
than females tend to outright, um, use outright manipulation

202
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.280
as a technique to get ahead in the world.

203
00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:54.130
And what about uh some general biological differences? I

204
00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.229
mean, are there any notable biological differences between big

205
00:11:58.239 --> 00:12:00.729
liars and the general population?

206
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:06.630
There's really limited research on this topic. Um There

207
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.619
is um there has been some research looking at

208
00:12:10.289 --> 00:12:13.530
um a gray matter and white matter in the

209
00:12:13.539 --> 00:12:16.500
brain. So, gray matter are essentially the the neurons

210
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.489
and white matter are the pathways the myelinated axons.

211
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.109
And um there's some research suggesting that people who

212
00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:30.250
lie extraordinarily have uh more white matter to gray

213
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:35.789
matter ratio than, than non prolific liars in the

214
00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:37.950
frontal lobe of the brain. So this is the

215
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.900
frontal lobe of the brain is, you know, one

216
00:12:39.909 --> 00:12:41.909
of the parts of the brain that are really

217
00:12:41.919 --> 00:12:46.940
essential for executive processes like um you know, plans

218
00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:50.349
making and things like that. And so there's been

219
00:12:50.359 --> 00:12:55.219
some speculation in the literature that um these differences

220
00:12:55.229 --> 00:12:59.320
and executive functioning processes due to differences in underlying

221
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:04.109
biology might be relevant to these patterns that we

222
00:13:04.119 --> 00:13:06.419
see with some people lying less and some people

223
00:13:06.429 --> 00:13:11.780
lying more. Um, THERE'S also evidence that dishonesty is

224
00:13:11.789 --> 00:13:15.070
a heritable trait. So it's maybe it's coded in

225
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.340
our genes to a certain extent. Um, AND so

226
00:13:18.349 --> 00:13:21.099
the heritability is about 30% which means about may,

227
00:13:21.109 --> 00:13:24.380
maybe about 30% of the variability that we have

228
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.919
and people's tendency to be honest is related to

229
00:13:26.929 --> 00:13:30.669
our underlying genes. And, um, and certainly there's heritability

230
00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:34.520
for things like, um, like psychopathy and just that

231
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.250
tendency to, you know, take advantage of others without

232
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.400
having much remorse about it. So, so those, that's

233
00:13:41.409 --> 00:13:44.219
probably about the extent that we can say anything,

234
00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:49.090
um, definitive about the underlying biology of being a

235
00:13:49.099 --> 00:13:50.000
big liar.

236
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.669
By the way, when it comes to possibly thinking

237
00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:57.940
about honesty as a trait as a personality trait,

238
00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.909
I guess in this case, does it relate in

239
00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:03.440
any way to the exec personality traits? Because one

240
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.409
of them is honesty, humility. Is there any relationship

241
00:14:07.419 --> 00:14:08.590
there or, or not?

242
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.130
Oh, sure. And that's one of the ways that

243
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.140
we assess, you know, honesty and dishonesty is using

244
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.690
the Hexaco traits. Um, WE have a few other

245
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.250
measures of honesty and dishonesty. But, but, um, yeah,

246
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.250
that, that broad personality trait, um, uh, is, um,

247
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.090
is a principal measure that we use.

248
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:33.010
And what about culture and the context where people

249
00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.320
live in? Does that also play a role in

250
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.489
shaping the differences between big liars and the rest

251
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.250
of the people.

252
00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:46.729
Uh, IT, it does. And we can, you know,

253
00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:48.520
when we think about culture, we can think about

254
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.989
the, the very local level, like the, the family

255
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.969
that someone lives in. There's great variability there. And,

256
00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:00.669
um, so I, I teach a seminar on Deception.

257
00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:03.090
I talk with my students about the families they

258
00:15:03.099 --> 00:15:06.559
grow up in and there's, there's a wide range

259
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:11.010
of, uh, of, um, styles, uh, and attitudes toward

260
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.330
honesty and dishonesty that we see where now some

261
00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.049
students who talk about their parents have raised them

262
00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:19.369
and told them if you can get ahead by

263
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.989
lying, you should, you know, so they're really almost

264
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.960
encouraging. Um LYING is a strategy. And we see

265
00:15:26.969 --> 00:15:32.030
that in families where um the parents are very

266
00:15:32.039 --> 00:15:35.650
punitive, um the Children tend to lie a lot

267
00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:40.000
more, uh actually in families where uh a person

268
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.200
just has siblings, they tend to lie a lot

269
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.030
more. So there's something about sibling dynamics that might

270
00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:47.039
be relevant. But if we look at culture more

271
00:15:47.049 --> 00:15:50.429
broadly, what we do see is that, for example,

272
00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:55.940
across countries, there's different attitudes about dishonesty and honesty

273
00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.950
and it's kind of uh really domain specific. And

274
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.309
so for example, in some countries and certain um

275
00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.059
occupational fields, it's accepted to be dishonest and not

276
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.140
in other fields. And so, but very broadly, yeah,

277
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.489
we do see um across countries, when we ask

278
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.049
people about their tendency to lie in some countries,

279
00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:19.890
people lie a lot more than in others. And

280
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.969
it seems to track, uh along with, um with

281
00:16:23.979 --> 00:16:27.530
broad social organizations. So in countries where there's a

282
00:16:27.539 --> 00:16:30.330
lot of corruption, for example, the individuals in those

283
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.570
countries tend to lie a lot

284
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.530
more. And I guess that there are also cultures

285
00:16:35.539 --> 00:16:40.369
where, I mean, you're not allowed to express certain

286
00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.750
ideas or say certain things out of politeness and

287
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.450
courtesy, I guess, like, for example, Japan and places

288
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.700
like that where there are things that people really

289
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:55.830
feel very, very uneasy saying, but not, not, I,

290
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.969
I'm not sure if that's actual dishonesty because it's

291
00:16:59.979 --> 00:17:03.950
done out of politeness, courtesy and stuff like that.

292
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.118
But I mean, perhaps from our point of view

293
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.079
it would be dishonest in a way. Right.

294
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.410
Yeah, sure. You know, the, the, the taboos, um,

295
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:19.020
uh, vary considerably from one culture to another. And

296
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.880
so in countries where there are a lot of

297
00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.680
taboo topics, you'd expect there to be a lot

298
00:17:23.689 --> 00:17:27.739
of, um, less than fully honest communication. And we

299
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.640
can actually see that historically in western Europe, um,

300
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:36.000
how honesty and dishonesty has been treated and how

301
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.199
it's been interpreted has changed considerably over like the

302
00:17:39.209 --> 00:17:44.849
past 500 years. Um, AND, uh, where at certain

303
00:17:44.859 --> 00:17:49.000
times it would be considered deeply, deeply offensive to

304
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.939
be honest. And so it was expected or encouraged

305
00:17:51.949 --> 00:17:54.729
to be dishonest. And we can see that even

306
00:17:54.739 --> 00:17:57.359
in, like, in the United States right now that,

307
00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:01.900
you know, Children are are taught not to uh

308
00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.790
express their true feelings about a gift they've received.

309
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.780
For example, if they receive a gift that they

310
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.510
don't like, they're, they're uh indoctrinated into this uh

311
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.270
style of, of acting as if they do like

312
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.989
it and commenting about how much they enjoy it

313
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.189
when they actually don't.

314
00:18:18.739 --> 00:18:23.380
Mhm. Does uh this kind of big lying, have

315
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.750
anything to do with personal philosophies?

316
00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:33.689
Sure. Um WE, we uh have a, a scale

317
00:18:33.699 --> 00:18:37.099
or a measurement that we use, um, fairly often

318
00:18:37.109 --> 00:18:41.280
that assesses people's attitudes toward lying and it asks

319
00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.520
questions like, you know, it's ok to lie sometimes

320
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.160
and people strongly agree or strongly disagree. And what

321
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.810
we see is that there's pretty wide variability in

322
00:18:51.819 --> 00:18:55.819
people's attitudes about honesty and the importance of honesty.

323
00:18:55.829 --> 00:19:00.869
And some people see honesty is absolutely essential and

324
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.329
they fret that they're not being honest enough and

325
00:19:04.339 --> 00:19:08.569
other people have a more cavalier attitude about honesty

326
00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:13.760
or dishonesty and feel like dishonesty is necessary and

327
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.800
there's nothing particularly wrong with it. And so they

328
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.290
are much more apt to lie.

329
00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:24.859
And, I mean, why is it, what motivates these

330
00:19:24.869 --> 00:19:29.869
big liars? Exactly. I mean, why do they lie

331
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.910
so prolifically and monumentally sometimes, at least

332
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.140
there's a lot of, uh, different reasons why people

333
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.449
lie lying is really just a strategy that we

334
00:19:43.459 --> 00:19:46.410
use to, you know, achieve, uh, you know, that

335
00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.130
the outcomes that we want to experience. And so

336
00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:52.650
in some cases, you know, people are wanting to

337
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:57.250
facilitate social relationships. And so they lie in order

338
00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.900
to, you know, bond with people or feel a

339
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:03.290
sense of connection with people. Um IN other cases,

340
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.560
people are trying to gain a financial advantage or

341
00:20:06.569 --> 00:20:09.130
a power advantage. And so they're lying for those

342
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.449
reasons. So, um you know, the, the motivations for

343
00:20:13.459 --> 00:20:16.670
lying are as, as varied as the motivations for

344
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.719
doing anything we do in the world. Um And

345
00:20:19.729 --> 00:20:21.900
so, you know, it's really kind of hard to

346
00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.849
talk about why people lie or what the motivations

347
00:20:25.859 --> 00:20:28.859
are because it's simply a tool that people use.

348
00:20:28.869 --> 00:20:30.339
You know, and, and we, we have a, a

349
00:20:30.349 --> 00:20:35.260
lot of psychological manipulation tools in our toolbox that

350
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.349
help us achieve our goals. And at the end

351
00:20:37.359 --> 00:20:39.619
of the day, lying is just one of those.

352
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:44.770
So getting into another possible aspect of what leads

353
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.660
big liars to become a big liar. So, uh

354
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.469
is there anything about uh developmental psychology? I mean,

355
00:20:53.479 --> 00:20:58.650
their childhood development that is special or not?

356
00:20:59.989 --> 00:21:04.250
Well, we see that um patterns of lying emerge

357
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.489
early in life. And so in developmental psychology studies,

358
00:21:08.819 --> 00:21:12.050
we see that most Children will start lying between

359
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.530
the ages of two and three and they're usually

360
00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.250
not very good at it, they fumble around, they're

361
00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.689
not very convincing. Um Yeah, and, but as they

362
00:21:22.699 --> 00:21:25.000
get older, by the time Children are five or

363
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:27.750
six, they're pretty good at, at telling lies that

364
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.640
completely convince their parents for example. Um And so

365
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.400
the trajectories that we see is that most Children

366
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.609
lie more and more as they get older until

367
00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:42.489
they reach adolescence. Um But then we see this

368
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.329
kind of break in the trajectories where most, for

369
00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:48.420
most people, their lying tends to, um start to

370
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.359
decline at that point. And one of the reasons

371
00:21:51.369 --> 00:21:55.709
is that there are pretty harsh, uh, social and

372
00:21:55.719 --> 00:21:59.280
reputational consequences for being known as a liar. And

373
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.459
so we've probably all had experiences where we've been

374
00:22:02.469 --> 00:22:06.500
caught in a lie. And so people start to

375
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.400
learn that there are more uh socially productive ways

376
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:12.439
to get what we want other than lying. And

377
00:22:12.449 --> 00:22:15.260
so that, that trajectory is they tend to um

378
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.449
lie less. But for some Children, that trajectory just

379
00:22:18.459 --> 00:22:22.170
uh keeps on in, in an upward direction. And

380
00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.290
so, uh we can start to see these patterns

381
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.119
of who are going to be the big liars

382
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.719
and who aren't pretty early on when we look

383
00:22:29.729 --> 00:22:33.349
at like pathological liars and we interview them and

384
00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:36.369
we ask them, you know, when their lying first

385
00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.609
became really problematic in their lives, for the vast

386
00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:41.729
majority of them is during adolescence,

387
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.579
a and in the book, you talk about different

388
00:22:46.589 --> 00:22:52.770
types of liars, like for example, storytellers, exaggerators, pathological

389
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.339
liars. And we'll come back to the pathological liars

390
00:22:55.349 --> 00:22:59.260
specifically later on in our conversation and also psychopath.

391
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:03.709
So, uh are these all different kinds of big

392
00:23:03.719 --> 00:23:07.810
liars? And if so what distinguishes them from one

393
00:23:07.819 --> 00:23:08.329
another.

394
00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:14.589
Well, the, uh, the, the, they are all liars

395
00:23:14.599 --> 00:23:17.339
and, and they're, yeah, I'd say they're different types

396
00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:20.849
and essentially there are different motivations for them all.

397
00:23:21.189 --> 00:23:25.089
Um, THE storytellers and exaggerators. These are people who

398
00:23:25.099 --> 00:23:29.579
are primarily, uh, telling lies because they like the

399
00:23:29.589 --> 00:23:32.640
positive attention that comes their way when they're telling

400
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.140
these exaggerated outrageous stories. So, you know, I, I

401
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.790
grew up, uh, down the street from a person

402
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.660
who told, told wild stories all the time and

403
00:23:41.869 --> 00:23:44.520
I think everyone knew that they were alive, but

404
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.479
they were just so outrageous that we couldn't turn

405
00:23:47.489 --> 00:23:50.430
away. And so, uh so I think some people,

406
00:23:50.439 --> 00:23:54.469
some storytellers uh that is their motivation is that,

407
00:23:54.479 --> 00:23:57.219
that warm glow of attention when they're, when they're

408
00:23:57.229 --> 00:24:02.239
um saying these outrageous things, um uh path, uh

409
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.500
the psychopaths. On the other hand, these are people

410
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:11.869
that, you know, callously and remorselessly use others and,

411
00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.479
and take advantage of others to get what they

412
00:24:14.489 --> 00:24:18.619
want. And so their motivation is to treat other

413
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.890
people as just mere objects or pawns in their

414
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.810
game to get what they want in the world.

415
00:24:24.819 --> 00:24:28.780
And so they have a much more selfish and

416
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:33.250
self serving ambitions and goals and uh that disregard

417
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.939
of the, the rights and welfare of others. And

418
00:24:36.949 --> 00:24:38.380
so, you know, you can kind of see the,

419
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.339
the big distinction there. But then I, as I

420
00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:45.140
mentioned earlier, we also have people who lie considerably,

421
00:24:45.619 --> 00:24:50.119
um because they they believe themselves to be inadequate.

422
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.250
And so they're, you know, have this um painfully

423
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.160
low self esteem where they feel like they're just

424
00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.119
never measuring up. And the only way they can

425
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.839
feel good about themselves is to present a false

426
00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:04.630
version of themselves to the rest of

427
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.140
the world. A and so I, I mean, there

428
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.339
are in the book, you mentioned several different occupations

429
00:25:12.349 --> 00:25:15.670
where we find some big liars, but before getting

430
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.829
into the occupations themselves, le legitimate occupations in this

431
00:25:19.839 --> 00:25:24.319
case, what about scam artists? Is there anything special

432
00:25:24.329 --> 00:25:25.010
about them?

433
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.439
You know? Uh I, I don't know if there's

434
00:25:29.449 --> 00:25:33.189
anything special about them, although they, they tend to

435
00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:36.670
have psychopathic traits that is, they, they tend to

436
00:25:36.829 --> 00:25:40.810
not have a lot of empathic regard for others.

437
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.280
Um BUT they, they also are really good at

438
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:48.780
justifying their bad behavior and um and we're all

439
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.869
good at justifying our bad behavior, but they tend

440
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.609
to be pretty exceptional at it where they tend

441
00:25:55.619 --> 00:25:59.760
to have a philosophy or a belief that uh

442
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:03.300
what they're doing isn't really all that bad. And

443
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:05.920
so I'm not really harming someone because they have

444
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:09.260
plenty of money or they would do the exact

445
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.040
same thing to me if they could. Therefore, it's

446
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.739
fine for me to do it to them. And

447
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.760
so when we look at um and scam artists

448
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.489
and, and other criminals for that matter, they tend

449
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.949
to be pretty adept at finding justifications for their

450
00:26:25.959 --> 00:26:29.040
own behavior. I think most of us do that

451
00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:32.189
to a certain degree. But we, we get to

452
00:26:32.199 --> 00:26:35.949
a line where we eventually have this self-recognition that

453
00:26:35.959 --> 00:26:39.530
I'm being a bad person. I'm being the type

454
00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.739
of person I don't wanna be and it prevents

455
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:46.150
us from, from carrying out too many um uh

456
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.270
too many awful things.

457
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:52.829
A and so there are certain occupations that you

458
00:26:52.839 --> 00:26:56.410
talk about in the book where people, uh I

459
00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.849
mean, there are sanctioned lies there uh or some

460
00:26:59.859 --> 00:27:03.219
frequent sanctioned lies like for example, in the case

461
00:27:03.229 --> 00:27:08.170
of lawyers, doctors and politicians. So, uh I mean,

462
00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.709
is it the case that perhaps in these kinds

463
00:27:10.719 --> 00:27:15.339
of occupations, we find a higher proportion of uh

464
00:27:15.349 --> 00:27:19.430
quote unquote big liars than in the general population.

465
00:27:19.439 --> 00:27:22.540
And uh and if so why

466
00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:26.770
we, we do and I guess I don't wanna

467
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.130
lump all these occupations in together when talking about

468
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.319
this. Uh YOU know, for example, when we, when

469
00:27:32.329 --> 00:27:35.969
we look at uh uh physicians, um most of

470
00:27:35.979 --> 00:27:38.800
them report that they're not fully honest with their

471
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:42.099
patients. And so they'll do things like they report

472
00:27:42.109 --> 00:27:46.989
that they're, they give overly optimistic uh prognoses uh

473
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.790
for their very ill patients in order for their

474
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.079
patients to have more hope. And so this is

475
00:27:52.089 --> 00:27:55.229
really kind of a benevolent lie. Like the, the

476
00:27:55.239 --> 00:27:58.300
doctors are lying for their own sake, they're lying

477
00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:02.170
for the sake of their patients. Um And usually

478
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.540
they're not even outright lies. It's kind of like,

479
00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.760
as we talked about before, we can minimize, we

480
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.810
can just not talk about certain things. And, um,

481
00:28:09.819 --> 00:28:13.579
but when we look at, um, in, in, in

482
00:28:13.589 --> 00:28:17.410
the field of sales, for example, what we find

483
00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.069
is that, you know, lying or being dishonest, maybe

484
00:28:21.079 --> 00:28:25.209
not lying, um, necessarily, but being dishonest is oftentimes,

485
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.920
uh, an important trait and it's actually valued by

486
00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.670
employers, you know, and so, uh, if you're trying

487
00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:37.650
to sell an inferior product at the same price

488
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.829
as a superior project, that's an impossible task if

489
00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:42.469
you're being honest all the time. And so we

490
00:28:42.479 --> 00:28:46.920
need to exaggerate advantages and minimize flaws and things

491
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:50.739
like that. And in, in politics, what we find

492
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.150
is that, you know, people, when we ask people,

493
00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.599
what, in what fields are people more honest or

494
00:28:57.609 --> 00:29:02.010
dishonest. People tend to, um, tend to list politics

495
00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.920
as being uh a field in which people are

496
00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.510
most dishonest. And there's some truth to that. Um,

497
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.410
POLITICIANS are placed in a difficult position of trying

498
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.609
to please a broad constituency where people have different,

499
00:29:15.619 --> 00:29:18.959
uh goals and wants and needs. And so trying

500
00:29:18.969 --> 00:29:21.040
to please everyone is difficult to do if you're

501
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.569
being honest all the time. But what we find

502
00:29:23.579 --> 00:29:28.459
is that politicians, uh politics is in a field

503
00:29:28.469 --> 00:29:31.939
is not a field where dishonest people, um enter

504
00:29:31.949 --> 00:29:35.219
that field, the people who enter politics are just

505
00:29:35.229 --> 00:29:38.459
as honest as, um any other person in the

506
00:29:38.469 --> 00:29:43.020
general population. What we see is that once people

507
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.119
enter into politics, the pressures are put on them

508
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.300
where they find that they need to become dishonest.

509
00:29:49.689 --> 00:29:53.420
And in fact, um, there's some research in Western

510
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.660
Europe showing that politicians who are willing to lie

511
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.979
are much more likely to be re-elected than politicians

512
00:30:00.989 --> 00:30:03.459
who are unwilling to lie. So, uh, so it

513
00:30:03.469 --> 00:30:07.349
might be that the field itself, um, molds people

514
00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:08.729
into being big liars.

515
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.890
So it seems that at least in some uh

516
00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:17.750
some prominent occupations, uh being dishonest, uh gets you

517
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.560
places. Right.

518
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.069
Absolutely.

519
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.109
So let me ask you about one particular topic

520
00:30:26.119 --> 00:30:30.920
now. So people also sometimes lie in relationships but

521
00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:36.989
particularly in romantic relationships. So why do people lie

522
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.140
in those cases specifically? I mean, what are their

523
00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:45.270
motivations and what do they usually lie about

524
00:30:47.119 --> 00:30:50.630
what they lie about? And their motivations probably depends

525
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.979
a lot on the, the phase of the relationship.

526
00:30:53.989 --> 00:30:57.849
And so there's a lot of research on um

527
00:30:57.859 --> 00:31:00.719
kind of the, the initial phases, the dating phase

528
00:31:00.729 --> 00:31:05.920
of relationships. And um looking at online dating websites,

529
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.540
for example, both men and women tend to be

530
00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:13.839
uh fairly dishonest when they're describing themselves, their attitudes,

531
00:31:13.849 --> 00:31:17.270
their history. And essentially, you know, if we're on

532
00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.920
the dating market, we're trying to make the best

533
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.890
case for ourselves. We, we're trying to market ourselves

534
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.949
and the way that we pull that off is

535
00:31:24.959 --> 00:31:31.020
exaggerating positives and minimizing, minimizing negative traits. And so,

536
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.849
um for example, men know that women, uh, oftentimes

537
00:31:36.859 --> 00:31:40.260
have a, a particular height standard that they're looking

538
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.719
for in prospective mates. And so men tend to

539
00:31:42.729 --> 00:31:45.400
exaggerate how tall they are. They also tend to

540
00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:49.160
exaggerate, um, the, the, the status or the, uh,

541
00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:53.319
of their, uh, profession or the amount of income

542
00:31:53.329 --> 00:31:55.790
they have and things like that and, and women

543
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.079
do the same thing just, uh, you know, they

544
00:31:58.089 --> 00:32:01.709
lie about things that are being selected on, um,

545
00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:05.089
by, by, um, people who are looking at them

546
00:32:05.099 --> 00:32:09.489
as mates. Um Now once you get into established

547
00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:15.020
relationships, um, the, you know, the, the, the tension

548
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.800
around, uh, uh uh those, um, types of traits

549
00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:21.349
are probably much less. And so the topics that

550
00:32:21.359 --> 00:32:24.349
people lie about start to differ. Um What we

551
00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:27.520
find is that men and women in relationships do

552
00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:30.479
lie to each other even in well established relationships.

553
00:32:30.489 --> 00:32:34.119
But the, the lies tend to be focused on

554
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:38.829
maintaining uh peace and harmony in the relationship. And

555
00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:42.530
so people will, will lie in order to prevent

556
00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.880
a fight from emerging or, but they also lie

557
00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.989
for benevolent reasons, um, to boost the sen the

558
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.599
sense of self esteem and their partners. Um And

559
00:32:53.609 --> 00:32:56.219
so the, the lies tend to be more supportive

560
00:32:56.229 --> 00:32:59.420
in nature, but certainly when people are doing bad

561
00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:02.270
things in relationships, they'll lie about it. So, you

562
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.599
know, people lie about their Infidelities and, and, um,

563
00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:09.189
you know, drug habits and things like that. Um

564
00:33:09.199 --> 00:33:11.530
But again, you know, their, what their, what their

565
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.920
ultimate goal is, is to try to preserve their

566
00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.800
relationship and they're using lies to make that happen.

567
00:33:17.349 --> 00:33:20.199
But we've, we've studied lies within the context of

568
00:33:20.209 --> 00:33:24.849
people's sexual relationships as well. And what we found

569
00:33:24.859 --> 00:33:28.459
in those cases is that the, the majority of

570
00:33:28.469 --> 00:33:31.030
the reasons that people are lying in the context

571
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.500
of their sex lives is to make their partners

572
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:37.540
feel better. So they, they feign enthusiasm and they,

573
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.790
they lie about the fact that they're, you know,

574
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.959
also thinking about other people and, and things like

575
00:33:43.969 --> 00:33:47.280
that, but the, the goal that they, um are

576
00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.890
trying to achieve, at least their self reported goal

577
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.290
is to try to make the experience more pleasant

578
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.189
for their partners.

579
00:33:55.099 --> 00:34:00.560
And what about familial relationships and friendships? Because sometimes

580
00:34:00.569 --> 00:34:03.760
people also lie in those contexts, right.

581
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:10.938
Yeah, absolutely. Um, WE, we see in, in adolescence,

582
00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:15.239
for example, the people they lie to most is

583
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.719
their friends. We thought it'd be parents but it's

584
00:34:17.728 --> 00:34:21.188
their, their friends. And, um, and when we look

585
00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:24.219
at why they're lying, it's, it's oftentimes, you know,

586
00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.560
getting back to this idea of they're trying to

587
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.340
save face, they're trying to present themselves as being,

588
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:34.080
you know, more desirable as, as uh friends than

589
00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.860
perhaps they feel like they are. But when we

590
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.020
look at adult in adults, um people tend to

591
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.570
be pretty honest with their close friends. Um, YOU

592
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.050
know, all of us have this, uh, this, this

593
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:51.708
desire to present genuine versions of ourselves to people

594
00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.889
who will accept us. And when we have those

595
00:34:53.899 --> 00:34:57.439
close friendships with people, we tend to seek them

596
00:34:57.449 --> 00:35:00.040
as the, the outlets where we'll be most honest

597
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:02.280
about who we are and what we're thinking and,

598
00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:04.419
and our wants and desires and so forth.

599
00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:08.810
Mhm. And I, I mean, talking, uh, a little

600
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.610
bit since we're talking about relationships, getting a little

601
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.590
bit into some of the negative aspects and consequences

602
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.870
of lying in this context. So what are the

603
00:35:19.879 --> 00:35:25.020
ways by which social relationships get fractured by deception?

604
00:35:26.439 --> 00:35:32.530
Well, you know, trust is, uh, is really, uh,

605
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.469
can be difficult to build and it takes time

606
00:35:35.479 --> 00:35:37.330
to build like to us. Like if you just

607
00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.939
imagine the person who you trust more than anyone

608
00:35:39.949 --> 00:35:42.649
in the world, the reason you trust them is

609
00:35:42.929 --> 00:35:46.810
they've established this very long track record of being

610
00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:51.550
honest and, and being a, a trustworthy partner. Um,

611
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.790
BUT it's also very easy to fracture that trust.

612
00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.570
You know, just one lie can, uh, undo all

613
00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.010
of the, the trust that's been built up over

614
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:06.600
years, but we do treat lies differently. And so

615
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:09.840
not all lies are, are given the same moral

616
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:15.179
weight and, or ethical weight. And so when within

617
00:36:15.189 --> 00:36:18.459
relationships, for example, if people find that someone has

618
00:36:18.469 --> 00:36:21.149
told a white lie, they tend to overlook that

619
00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:24.239
and it doesn't really damage the trust. However, if

620
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.399
someone is caught telling a selfish lie where they're

621
00:36:27.409 --> 00:36:30.810
taking advantage of their close partner, then, then obviously

622
00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.360
that's gonna fracture the trust and, uh, you know,

623
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:37.020
and, and in some cases, the, the trust is

624
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.969
fractured to such a degree that it's impossible to

625
00:36:39.979 --> 00:36:43.969
rebuild. Um, IF we look at, you know, within

626
00:36:43.979 --> 00:36:46.169
friendships, but we can also look more broadly at

627
00:36:46.179 --> 00:36:50.040
trust. We can, we can see that the amount

628
00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.820
of trust between people varies quite a bit from

629
00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:56.449
one location to another, from one country to another

630
00:36:56.459 --> 00:37:00.320
or one society to another. Um, uh, THERE'S a,

631
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.120
a book out that, uh, that covers, uh, distrust

632
00:37:04.129 --> 00:37:08.340
within a small Romanian village where essentially no one

633
00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:12.889
trusts each other. And it's, it's really remarkable how,

634
00:37:12.899 --> 00:37:17.489
um, how different that, so that society operates when

635
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.469
you only can really count on a small handful

636
00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:23.590
of people and everyone else is essentially viewed as

637
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.469
a danger or a threat. And so,

638
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.219
but by the way, by the way, just one

639
00:37:28.229 --> 00:37:30.889
second, the book you're talking about is living with

640
00:37:30.899 --> 00:37:33.020
distrust by Rabu Umbridge.

641
00:37:33.639 --> 00:37:35.750
That's correct. That's correct. Yeah. Yeah,

642
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.149
I, I've had him on my show. So, yeah,

643
00:37:38.159 --> 00:37:41.370
it's, it's, it sounded familiar.

644
00:37:41.699 --> 00:37:44.850
Yeah. Yeah. So it's really remarkable when you read

645
00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.100
about what it's like to live in a deeply

646
00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:51.330
distrustful society compared to a trustful one. It's, uh,

647
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.050
it's much more challenging.

648
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.080
Yeah. And so, I mean, are there any specific

649
00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:03.310
cases where perhaps people might need interventions to reduce

650
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.649
lying in relationships? And if so, are there those

651
00:38:07.659 --> 00:38:09.429
kinds of interventions.

652
00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:14.330
Yes. Uh There are people, I get emails from

653
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:19.739
people at least weekly um explaining that they're lying

654
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.139
or their partners lying or their children's lying is

655
00:38:23.149 --> 00:38:27.139
causing massive problems within their relationships and they're asking

656
00:38:27.149 --> 00:38:29.780
me for help. So there's, there's certainly people who

657
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:33.459
experience lying is out of control and in need

658
00:38:33.469 --> 00:38:38.250
of some uh change. And uh I think fortunately

659
00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.600
the, the um standard um tools that we have

660
00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:47.780
for psychological intervention for other types of problems are

661
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:51.979
pretty um effective for helping people deal with lying,

662
00:38:51.989 --> 00:38:55.909
standard cognitive behavior, therapies. For example, you know, a

663
00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:59.469
lot of the reasons that people lie is um

664
00:38:59.479 --> 00:39:03.110
because of how they're thinking about the world and,

665
00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.929
and what they're seeing is there options for interacting

666
00:39:05.939 --> 00:39:08.560
with people and we can help people cultivate tools

667
00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.439
to find different strategies for getting the same things

668
00:39:11.449 --> 00:39:12.879
they're trying to achieve.

669
00:39:14.169 --> 00:39:18.010
So going, getting back to the big liars, I

670
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:21.189
would like to uh hear a little bit more

671
00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:25.389
about, let's say they, their models operandi. So how

672
00:39:25.399 --> 00:39:29.379
do they get away with their lies? Exactly. Do

673
00:39:29.389 --> 00:39:34.709
they usually resort to particular strategies or tactics or

674
00:39:34.719 --> 00:39:36.389
how, how do they go about it?

675
00:39:37.889 --> 00:39:41.219
We've, we've interviewed a lot of people about their

676
00:39:41.229 --> 00:39:46.070
strategies for lying. Um And it's pretty interesting because

677
00:39:46.629 --> 00:39:50.929
we all have ideas about how liars behave. And

678
00:39:50.939 --> 00:39:54.229
so when we ask uh people, you know, what,

679
00:39:54.239 --> 00:39:55.939
what are liars look like? Like how can you

680
00:39:55.949 --> 00:39:59.139
tell if someone's lying, they say, well, liars, avoid

681
00:39:59.149 --> 00:40:02.610
eye contact and liars fidget a lot. And liars

682
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.770
touch their face and liars, stutter and stammer. But

683
00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:10.409
when we ask liars how they tell convincing lies,

684
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.750
they essentially do the opposite of those things. They

685
00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.669
say, I make eye contact. I try not to

686
00:40:16.679 --> 00:40:20.489
fidget. I try not to stutter and stammer. Um

687
00:40:20.729 --> 00:40:22.629
So those are some of the techniques that they

688
00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:25.530
use is, um, is just to try to look

689
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.050
normal is what most of them say. And so

690
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.300
we have a, a sense of what our normal

691
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:33.110
behavior looks like. And so we can just try

692
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.610
to continue to engage in that normal looking behavior

693
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:41.010
when we're telling lies, another strategy that um the

694
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.610
big liars report using is to plan their lies.

695
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.810
So if they know that the topic is gonna

696
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:50.370
come up, they plan in advance what they're gonna

697
00:40:50.379 --> 00:40:53.969
say. Um And they also plan the types of

698
00:40:53.979 --> 00:40:56.729
details that they're gonna reveal and the ones they

699
00:40:56.739 --> 00:41:01.469
won't reveal. And, and oftentimes a strategy, a strategy

700
00:41:01.479 --> 00:41:04.219
that they use is to bury a lie within

701
00:41:04.229 --> 00:41:06.280
a cloud of truth. So I can tell you

702
00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:08.540
a story that is almost entirely truthful. And then

703
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.840
there's just this one lie and that makes it

704
00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:14.199
difficult to detect when most of what I'm saying

705
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.959
is coherent and consistent with the information that you

706
00:41:18.969 --> 00:41:22.060
already know. And so it appears truthful and then

707
00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:24.580
I just hide that one lie within the midst

708
00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:24.919
of it,

709
00:41:25.969 --> 00:41:29.560
by the way, are people generally good at lie

710
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:30.350
detection?

711
00:41:31.909 --> 00:41:36.409
No, they're not. They're actually pretty poor at lie

712
00:41:36.419 --> 00:41:39.610
detection. Um And so the way that we study,

713
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:43.179
uh, you know, how good people are detecting lies

714
00:41:43.189 --> 00:41:47.520
is we, we typically record videos of people who

715
00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:50.520
are lying or telling the truth. And then we

716
00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.250
show these videos to participants in our study and

717
00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.550
we just ask them to identify who are the

718
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.489
liars and who are the people who are being

719
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.439
honest. And in a lot of these studies, half

720
00:42:01.449 --> 00:42:03.629
of the videos are of liars and half of

721
00:42:03.639 --> 00:42:06.909
them are telling the truth. And we find that

722
00:42:06.919 --> 00:42:11.870
people are, their accuracy rates are around 54% where,

723
00:42:11.879 --> 00:42:14.600
you know, you get 50% accuracy just flipping a

724
00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:18.560
coin. And what this suggests is that people are

725
00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:22.840
really, really poor lie detectors and in the, in

726
00:42:22.850 --> 00:42:26.110
the cases where they do detect liars, it tends

727
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.639
to be because some people just aren't very good

728
00:42:28.649 --> 00:42:31.469
liars. There are some people who, when they're telling

729
00:42:31.479 --> 00:42:33.899
a lie, it's just kind of obvious. But those

730
00:42:33.909 --> 00:42:36.590
are the minority of people, the vast majority of

731
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:41.310
people are, is concerned when they're lying or being

732
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.199
honest just by looking at their body language or

733
00:42:44.209 --> 00:42:46.489
listening to their tone of speech and things like

734
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.540
that. So, so to answer your question, yeah, people

735
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:52.010
are not very good uh lie detecting and uh

736
00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:55.030
as a person who studies lying, I'm aware of

737
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.209
that myself. Uh, IN my classes, we do activities

738
00:42:58.219 --> 00:43:01.010
where people tell lies and tell the truth and

739
00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.679
I'm no better than the average person. And we

740
00:43:03.689 --> 00:43:07.370
actually see that in, uh, in, you know, professions

741
00:43:07.379 --> 00:43:10.320
where people are, you know, part of their job

742
00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:13.189
is to, to, to detect lying, like with police

743
00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:16.840
interrogators and things like that. They are no better

744
00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:20.659
than college students that watching these videos and figuring

745
00:43:20.669 --> 00:43:22.419
out who's lying, who's telling the truth.

746
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:28.669
And so how are most lies detected when they

747
00:43:28.679 --> 00:43:32.840
are detected? I mean, what makes for uh what,

748
00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:37.770
what leads to someone really uncovering a lie? Usually,

749
00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.340
you know, the, the primary way in the, in

750
00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:45.330
the way we study this is we just ask

751
00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.060
people like think of the last time you detected

752
00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.320
that someone was lying. How did you figure it

753
00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:54.229
out? Um What we find is that almost no

754
00:43:54.239 --> 00:43:58.239
one says, oh, they fidgeted or they weren't making

755
00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:00.639
eye contact, what they, what they talk about is

756
00:44:00.649 --> 00:44:03.500
evidence that they uncovered. So they say, oh, this

757
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.129
person said something, it was inconsistent with this other

758
00:44:07.139 --> 00:44:10.939
fact that I already knew about or they'll report

759
00:44:10.949 --> 00:44:15.100
that they had third party information. So my, you

760
00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:18.050
know, my romantic partner said they were at this

761
00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:20.149
party, but I talked to people with the who

762
00:44:20.159 --> 00:44:21.610
were at the party and they said, you know,

763
00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:24.129
my romantic partner wasn't there at all. And so,

764
00:44:24.419 --> 00:44:29.010
so that's how people tend to discover lies that

765
00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.250
um most lies go undiscovered. Uh When we ask

766
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.179
people about their lying and we ask them what

767
00:44:35.189 --> 00:44:37.969
proportion of your lies get discovered. They say it's

768
00:44:37.979 --> 00:44:41.010
a very, very small minority of lies that get

769
00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.810
discovered. I think part of that is we don't

770
00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.739
really care if someone tells me if I say,

771
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.649
how are you doing? And they say I'm doing

772
00:44:49.659 --> 00:44:52.790
fine. I don't really care if they're not doing

773
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.689
fine. I mean, in, in the sense where I'm

774
00:44:54.699 --> 00:44:56.510
gonna try and dig deeper and find out if

775
00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:01.510
they're lying. It's only in really consequential situations where

776
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.580
we realize someone's motivations might be at odds with

777
00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:09.389
ours. And the outcome of them being honest versus

778
00:45:09.399 --> 00:45:13.820
dishonest has um uh a, a deeply profound effect

779
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.419
on me. In those cases, I'll start digging and

780
00:45:16.429 --> 00:45:19.520
looking for additional information and, and even trying to

781
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:24.209
solicit confessions and things like that. Um So, uh

782
00:45:24.219 --> 00:45:26.709
that's, that tends to be how we uncover lying

783
00:45:26.719 --> 00:45:28.199
is by digging deeper.

784
00:45:28.989 --> 00:45:34.010
And two big liars themselves use particular strategies to

785
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.729
avoid detection.

786
00:45:37.379 --> 00:45:39.389
Yeah. What we find is that the people who

787
00:45:39.399 --> 00:45:42.399
are good liars tend to be really good actors

788
00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:46.830
that is they can feign emotions very well. Um

789
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.719
And they, they are also very good at controlling

790
00:45:49.729 --> 00:45:53.919
details and so they're very um selective and how

791
00:45:53.929 --> 00:45:57.409
they present information. Um BUT they tend to present

792
00:45:57.419 --> 00:46:02.120
themselves as friendly, confident, engaged with the person who

793
00:46:02.129 --> 00:46:05.639
they're talking to and they concoct when they do

794
00:46:05.649 --> 00:46:09.159
concoct lies, the lies tend to be very plausible

795
00:46:09.399 --> 00:46:11.320
and they present them in a way where they

796
00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:13.340
found where they sound very certain.

797
00:46:15.169 --> 00:46:18.260
And so, uh, earlier when we talked about relationships,

798
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:22.399
I, I asked you what sort of, uh, consequences

799
00:46:22.409 --> 00:46:27.580
might lying have on different kinds of social relationships.

800
00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:31.409
What about the effects that big liars can, there

801
00:46:31.419 --> 00:46:36.129
can have both on themselves and on society more

802
00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:36.790
generally?

803
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:40.810
Well, when we, um, look at the effect it

804
00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:43.570
has on themselves and we, when we talk to

805
00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:48.090
people, uh like pathological liars, like they feel awful

806
00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.689
like they, they come to us and, and, and

807
00:46:50.699 --> 00:46:53.800
want help because they feel like their lives are

808
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.320
unfolding or they feel like they just, uh you

809
00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:00.030
know, can't be genuine with anyone anymore. And so

810
00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:03.629
there's, you know, some pretty good evidence that when

811
00:47:03.639 --> 00:47:07.270
people lie a lot, they, they actually have neg

812
00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.040
negative outcomes for themselves in a lot of ways.

813
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.050
But, you know, when we look at, um, you

814
00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.909
know, the effects that big liars have on society

815
00:47:16.919 --> 00:47:20.820
more broadly, you know, they, they, you know, lying

816
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:24.810
in other forms of uh dishonesty lead to, you

817
00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.739
know, billions of dollars and fraud every year. And

818
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:32.250
so there's this massive societal consequence and, you know,

819
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.050
even when we look at politics, you know, when

820
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:40.580
people, um, um you know, develop this deep mistrust

821
00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:44.879
for politicians that it, you know, gravely alter society

822
00:47:44.889 --> 00:47:47.840
in a lot of ways. And so, so, yeah,

823
00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.949
uh you know, certainly lying can affect the individual,

824
00:47:50.959 --> 00:47:54.139
but the consequence of the lying permeates out into

825
00:47:54.149 --> 00:47:56.699
society and causes all sorts of mayhem.

826
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.790
Uh And so we've been referring to pathological liars

827
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.520
throughout our conversation, but what characterizes them? Exactly. And

828
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.919
I mean, is this some sort of a clinical

829
00:48:09.929 --> 00:48:11.639
diagnosis or not?

830
00:48:13.379 --> 00:48:15.679
So, yeah, we wrote a book that was published

831
00:48:15.689 --> 00:48:18.840
last year on a pathological lying and the, the

832
00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:21.290
reason we, and I'm talking about when I say

833
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.409
we uh my colleague uh Drew Curtis and I

834
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.860
um have been doing a lot of this research

835
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:31.469
on pathological lying. And we're interested in that because

836
00:48:31.479 --> 00:48:34.709
it's a topic that is, you know, familiar in

837
00:48:34.719 --> 00:48:37.199
our vernacular. We talk about pathological lying all the

838
00:48:37.209 --> 00:48:39.439
time when we use the term people seem to

839
00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:42.489
know what we mean. But um there hadn't been

840
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.330
any consistent research on this topic. The first people

841
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:49.770
that the first researchers that looked at pathological lying

842
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.370
were doing research on it over 100 years ago.

843
00:48:53.189 --> 00:48:56.989
Um But there hasn't been a consistent definition of

844
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.659
what the term means. And so in our review

845
00:49:00.669 --> 00:49:04.879
of the literature, we found 17 different definitions of

846
00:49:04.889 --> 00:49:08.459
pathological lying that have been used over the decades

847
00:49:08.709 --> 00:49:13.169
and there's a lot of inconsistency. Um And so

848
00:49:13.179 --> 00:49:16.270
when we started talking about pathological lying, we started

849
00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.969
thinking of it in the, the context of the

850
00:49:18.979 --> 00:49:24.290
way that we um identify other mental health disorders.

851
00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:29.100
So, pathology or psychopathology like anxiety disorders and mood

852
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:33.030
disorders like depression. When we're talking about those, we

853
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.169
tend to um think of the, the person as

854
00:49:36.399 --> 00:49:40.629
um having some uh adjustment problems in their relationships

855
00:49:40.639 --> 00:49:45.280
or in the workplace. They're also experiencing discomfort and

856
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:49.899
distress around this, this problem that they're having. Um

857
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:53.500
AND of oftentimes the disorder puts them at some

858
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.969
sort of risk, uh you know, um sometimes it's

859
00:49:56.979 --> 00:49:59.610
risk of, of injury or death and sometimes it's

860
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:02.530
risk of like incarceration and things like that. And

861
00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.949
so when we started thinking about pathological lying, we

862
00:50:04.959 --> 00:50:07.439
put it in that framework. So we talked about,

863
00:50:07.449 --> 00:50:11.760
we define pathological lying as um a a pattern

864
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:16.229
of excessive lying. That's oftentimes compulsive in nature, it

865
00:50:16.239 --> 00:50:19.169
causes disruption in people's lives, it causes them to

866
00:50:19.179 --> 00:50:23.209
experience distress and oftentimes puts them at, at risk.

867
00:50:23.929 --> 00:50:26.830
Uh But I mean, in terms of, let's say

868
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:32.949
disease classification, is there any category specific category for

869
00:50:32.959 --> 00:50:36.689
this kind of uh behavior that does it have

870
00:50:36.699 --> 00:50:41.300
any specific name or term in, for example, the

871
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.780
DS M or, or, or elsewhere?

872
00:50:44.669 --> 00:50:46.790
Yeah. So in the United States, we use the

873
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:50.610
DS M or the diagnostic and statistical manual of

874
00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:54.300
the American Psychiatric Association. And that's basically the, the

875
00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:58.189
book in which every recognized mental health disorder is

876
00:50:58.199 --> 00:51:02.560
listed along with the diagnostic criteria. And pathological lying

877
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:07.340
isn't listed as a um a diagnosis in, in

878
00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:11.340
that manual. Um IT'S listed as a, as a,

879
00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:15.219
a symptom of a few disorders, but uh like

880
00:51:15.229 --> 00:51:18.959
personality disorders. Uh FOR example, but, but not as

881
00:51:18.969 --> 00:51:21.560
a disorder in and of itself. So my colleague

882
00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:23.919
Drew Curtis is currently doing a lot of work

883
00:51:23.929 --> 00:51:27.659
to more better represent pathological lying. And he's doing

884
00:51:27.669 --> 00:51:32.179
some good work showing that some people exhibit pathological

885
00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:35.100
lying in the absence of any mental health disorder,

886
00:51:35.110 --> 00:51:38.360
any other mental health diagnosis which suggests maybe it

887
00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:41.820
is a stand alone condition and should be recognized

888
00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:44.409
as a stand alone um diagnosis.

889
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:48.189
Mhm. And, and I mean, if it would be

890
00:51:48.199 --> 00:51:52.429
recognized as a stand alone diagnosis, would you have,

891
00:51:52.439 --> 00:51:56.830
for example, a set of criteria for diagnosing someone

892
00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.810
as a pathological liar?

893
00:52:00.709 --> 00:52:03.760
Yeah. So uh and we're, we're working on some

894
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:07.489
diagnostic tools right now. So we have a uh

895
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.830
uh a diagnostic self report measure um that uh

896
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.820
is about to be published right now. It's under

897
00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:17.080
review at a journal. And um and so we've

898
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.760
done a lot of work validating it showing that

899
00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:22.679
people who seem to meet these criteria that we've

900
00:52:22.689 --> 00:52:27.020
set out for pathological lying have poorer life outcomes,

901
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:28.830
like they're more likely to have problems in their

902
00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.350
relationships, problems at work and so forth. They also

903
00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:36.050
um report higher levels of emotional distress on these

904
00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:39.270
different psychological measures that we've used to validate it.

905
00:52:39.419 --> 00:52:43.209
They also have this lifelong pattern of pathological lying.

906
00:52:43.219 --> 00:52:45.679
So the lying isn't just a, a response to

907
00:52:45.689 --> 00:52:48.780
a specific event in their life. And so, yeah,

908
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:52.409
there does seem to be some consistency with the

909
00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:55.250
way that we're defining it and the uh the,

910
00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:58.560
the symptoms and outcomes of these pathological liars are

911
00:52:58.570 --> 00:52:59.129
exhibiting.

912
00:52:59.679 --> 00:53:02.260
But in this particular case, since you're labeling it,

913
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:07.159
pathological lying, should we assume that people would have

914
00:53:07.169 --> 00:53:11.320
this condition when it's classified as a condition that

915
00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:14.760
they have no control over it, that they basically

916
00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:18.139
cannot help themselves if they don't get any sort

917
00:53:18.149 --> 00:53:20.199
of treatment or something like that.

918
00:53:21.899 --> 00:53:24.310
YOU know, that's that, that kind of gets down

919
00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:27.340
to, you know, deeper questions around free will and

920
00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:30.520
things like that. So to say that someone has

921
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:32.919
no control over something I think is a, a

922
00:53:32.929 --> 00:53:35.600
bit of a stretch like we have control over,

923
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.300
you know, most things in our lives, but the,

924
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:41.689
the difficulty we face controlling things like as someone

925
00:53:41.699 --> 00:53:45.500
who is uh uh addicted to smoking cigarettes, they,

926
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:47.939
they have control but they find that control very

927
00:53:47.949 --> 00:53:50.689
challenging. And so I think the goal that we

928
00:53:50.699 --> 00:53:54.010
have as psychologists is to offer people who are

929
00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:59.179
having difficulties controlling um coping mechanisms and strategies to

930
00:53:59.189 --> 00:54:02.100
help them better control uh those behaviors that they're

931
00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:03.520
trying to reduce.

932
00:54:04.629 --> 00:54:07.310
Uh And if this turns out to be a

933
00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:11.280
condition in and of itself, uh do you expect

934
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:14.409
it to uh uh do you expect that we

935
00:54:14.419 --> 00:54:16.979
will be able to treat it somehow? I mean,

936
00:54:16.989 --> 00:54:20.729
are there, for example, already any tools at our

937
00:54:20.739 --> 00:54:25.139
disposal to deal with other conditions where perhaps some

938
00:54:25.149 --> 00:54:28.379
of them might even have pathological lying as one

939
00:54:28.389 --> 00:54:32.070
of the criteria for diagnosis that would also or

940
00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:33.489
could also apply here.

941
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.919
Yeah, I believe so. And I, I mentioned earlier

942
00:54:36.929 --> 00:54:41.709
in our conversation, um, cognitive behavior therapy has, has

943
00:54:41.719 --> 00:54:45.850
demonstrated some effectiveness. And so essentially what we're doing

944
00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:49.090
with that therapy is we're helping people change their

945
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:52.290
beliefs and their attitudes about things that are going

946
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.800
on in their lives and the hope that those

947
00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.850
changes and beliefs will lead to changes in behavior.

948
00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.459
There's also some evidence that um you know, some

949
00:55:01.469 --> 00:55:05.770
pharmaceutical treatments might be effective um to help with

950
00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:10.370
like kind of compulsive behaviors um and anxiety as

951
00:55:10.379 --> 00:55:13.770
well. But all of this research is very, very

952
00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:18.270
preliminary. And so, uh my colleague, Doctor Curtis is,

953
00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.689
is uh starting to do some work trying to

954
00:55:20.699 --> 00:55:23.679
validate some of these treatments, but it's difficult because

955
00:55:23.689 --> 00:55:26.169
in order to, to carry out these days, you

956
00:55:26.179 --> 00:55:29.550
have to find a large enough group of pathological

957
00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.389
liars. And so it's pretty a pretty slow process.

958
00:55:32.399 --> 00:55:35.429
But, you know, we do have people um coming

959
00:55:35.439 --> 00:55:38.840
through his laboratory that uh we're beginning some of

960
00:55:38.850 --> 00:55:39.870
this research on.

961
00:55:40.719 --> 00:55:43.580
So let me just ask you one last question

962
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:48.100
earlier, we mentioned here how people usually are not

963
00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:52.179
very good at lie detection, but are there perhaps

964
00:55:52.189 --> 00:55:57.729
some scientifically validated ways that people can avoid being

965
00:55:58.034 --> 00:56:00.995
by liars? I mean, at least perhaps some things

966
00:56:01.004 --> 00:56:03.925
that people try to might try to pay attention

967
00:56:03.935 --> 00:56:07.375
to some strategies that they might use, like, for

968
00:56:07.385 --> 00:56:11.064
example, I'm not asking people particular things or paying

969
00:56:11.074 --> 00:56:13.675
attention to this or that, I mean, is there

970
00:56:13.685 --> 00:56:15.254
something like that or not?

971
00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:20.360
Yeah. Um I think the, the principal technique is

972
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:24.330
to, or the principal strategy is just to recognize

973
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:29.750
when another person's motives are in conflict with your

974
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.439
own. And that's when we tend to see dishonesty

975
00:56:32.449 --> 00:56:36.409
um occurring. And so just recognizing when that's happening

976
00:56:36.419 --> 00:56:40.699
is important, um but then we can also use

977
00:56:40.709 --> 00:56:45.379
strategies uh that include digging deeper for information. And

978
00:56:45.389 --> 00:56:48.790
so uh one strategy I use, I I, I'm

979
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.820
a professor, so I have students lying to me

980
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.340
all the time. And so I'll ask them for

981
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:56.729
more details about their story and sometimes they'll, you

982
00:56:56.739 --> 00:56:59.560
know, report details that are in conflict with something

983
00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:02.560
I already know, or they'll report details that are

984
00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:06.330
in conflict with something they've previously stated. And then

985
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:09.370
another strategy is to have people retell stories. And

986
00:57:09.379 --> 00:57:12.669
sometimes if it's a fabricated story, when they retell

987
00:57:12.679 --> 00:57:17.409
it, the details will change. Um But primarily what,

988
00:57:17.419 --> 00:57:21.949
what I look for is uh inconsistencies and when

989
00:57:21.959 --> 00:57:24.709
you see inconsistencies, that's when you, you know, you

990
00:57:24.719 --> 00:57:28.169
might wanna dig a bit deeper. Um AND then

991
00:57:28.179 --> 00:57:31.810
sometimes, uh you know, just asking for honesty is

992
00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:34.610
effective, you know, if we suspect someone is being

993
00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:39.629
dishonest, just simply uh soliciting a confession saying, like,

994
00:57:39.639 --> 00:57:41.379
look, I know that this is a hard thing

995
00:57:41.389 --> 00:57:43.689
to talk about but it's really important for me

996
00:57:43.699 --> 00:57:46.149
that we have an honest conversation here. Can you

997
00:57:46.159 --> 00:57:48.300
just give me the honest answer? And I'll accept

998
00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:50.409
that uh what we find is that a lot

999
00:57:50.419 --> 00:57:53.300
of people will just confess at that point. And

1000
00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:56.560
so really checking facts though is the, is the,

1001
00:57:56.570 --> 00:58:01.280
the key way. There's no uh secret uh technique

1002
00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:04.560
that you know, that, you know, Sherlock Holmes uses

1003
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:07.770
other than looking for the evidence. And so, so

1004
00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.070
that's what we focus on.

1005
00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:13.189
Great. So, Doctor Hart, let's send on that note

1006
00:58:13.199 --> 00:58:15.780
then and just to mention the books again, the

1007
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:19.290
latest one, big liars, what psychological science tells us

1008
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.320
about lying and how you can avoid being duped.

1009
00:58:22.429 --> 00:58:26.010
And the other one, pathological lying theory, research and

1010
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:28.820
practice. I'm leaving links to them in the description

1011
00:58:28.830 --> 00:58:31.739
box of this interview. And apart from the books,

1012
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:34.179
would you like also to tell people where they

1013
00:58:34.189 --> 00:58:36.739
can find you and your work on the internet?

1014
00:58:37.689 --> 00:58:40.379
Uh They can uh find me at my uh

1015
00:58:40.389 --> 00:58:46.060
my website um at Christian O heart.com and uh

1016
00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:49.030
and then on my academic website. Um But uh

1017
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.590
yeah, thanks so much for having me on the

1018
00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:53.070
show. I've really enjoyed the conversation. It's been a

1019
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:53.709
great time.

1020
00:58:54.179 --> 00:58:56.270
Ok, thank you so much for coming on the

1021
00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.270
show. It's been a pleasure to talk to you.

1022
00:58:58.919 --> 00:59:02.020
All right, thanks. Joy. Enjoyed the conversation. It's been

1023
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:02.689
a great time.

1024
00:59:03.149 --> 00:59:05.260
Ok. Thank you so much for coming on the

1025
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:07.260
show. It's been a pleasure to talk to you.

1026
00:59:07.899 --> 00:59:11.219
All right, thanks. Hi guys. Thank you for watching
