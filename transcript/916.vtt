00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.349
Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of

2
00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:04.320
the day host, Ricardo Loops. And today I'm

3
00:00:04.328 --> 00:00:07.320
joined by Doctor Christian Hart. He is a professor

4
00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:11.038
of Psychology at Texas Women's University where he is the

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.009
Director of the Psychological Science Program, as well as

6
00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.629
the director of the Human Deception Laboratory. His research

7
00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:21.829
explores the behavioral cues of deception, pathological, lying

8
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.100
, lying within relationships, lying, morality and the

9
00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.329
factors that influence decisions to be honest or deceptive.

10
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.500
And today we are focusing mostly on his two books

11
00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:37.340
, Pathological Lying Theory, Research and Practice and his

12
00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:41.158
latest one, big liars. What psychological science tells

13
00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:44.868
us about lying and how you can avoid being duped

14
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.798
. So Dr Hart, welcome to the show.

15
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.700
It's a big pleasure to everyone. Uh Thanks for

16
00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:52.179
having me, Ricardo. It's a great pleasure for

17
00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:53.618
me to be here. I'm a big fan of

18
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.228
your podcast. Well, thank you so much.

19
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.029
So, get, let's get right into it.

20
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.579
And I would like to start perhaps with a basic

21
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.689
question. So what is a lie exactly? I

22
00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.260
mean, since you approach, I guess lying and

23
00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:14.644
honesty from a psychological viewpoint, uh what counts really

24
00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:19.144
as a lie here. Uh we define lying as

25
00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:23.073
a, a communication that's intended to convince someone of

26
00:01:23.084 --> 00:01:27.275
something that we know is untrue. So, and

27
00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:29.924
, and, and when I say communication, we

28
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.734
, we usually mean uh the spoken word but also

29
00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:37.040
obviously the written word. Um but we also communicate

30
00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.099
using gestures and using silence. Um So any uh

31
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.879
natural communication that's that we use to try to impart

32
00:01:47.888 --> 00:01:51.329
um some information on someone else that we know to

33
00:01:51.338 --> 00:01:55.620
be untrue. And do we know before we get

34
00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:59.349
into lying itself, do we have good enough data

35
00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.519
to tell how honest people are in general or not

36
00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:07.868
? Well, the way that we study dishonesty and

37
00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:12.899
lying is, um, is primarily through self report

38
00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.050
. So we ask people and, you know,

39
00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:17.599
there's the inherent problem in there when we're asking people

40
00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.618
to self report about their behavior. Are they giving

41
00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.038
us accurate information, especially on a topic like dishonesty

42
00:02:24.618 --> 00:02:28.919
? And so we, we try to, um

43
00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:30.860
, you know, set the stage, uh,

44
00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:35.159
such that people will be, um, straightforward when

45
00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.099
they're telling us about their patterns of lying. And

46
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.360
one of the ways we do that is we,

47
00:02:39.838 --> 00:02:44.159
um, have them give us that information anonymously.

48
00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.879
So typically through anonymous online surveys. So there's no

49
00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.778
one judging them. So there's no real incentive to

50
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:53.270
, to, um, to be dishonest. Uh

51
00:02:53.278 --> 00:02:57.558
, we also normalize lying like we'll usually, uh

52
00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.449
, set the stage by, by telling people,

53
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.599
most people lie fairly regularly. Uh, almost everyone

54
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.409
lies at some point. And so now we want

55
00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.770
to know about your patterns of lying and, and

56
00:03:09.778 --> 00:03:13.588
we, we have some evidence that when people self

57
00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.368
report about their lying, they're actually giving us accurate

58
00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.868
information because uh you know, there are, there

59
00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.849
are uh experimental techniques where we could ask people whether

60
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.189
they lie a little or lie a lot and they'll

61
00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.849
tell us and, and then we can bring them

62
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.129
into the laboratory and set up contrived situations where they

63
00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.569
can, um, either be honest or they can

64
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.099
lie for a financial reward. And what we find

65
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.240
is people who say I tend to lie a lot

66
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.919
. They tend to actually lie in those laboratory situations

67
00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:46.550
. And then people who say they're particularly honest tend

68
00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:49.419
not to lie in those situations. So we have

69
00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.159
some validity checks that suggest those, uh, self

70
00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:54.939
report measures are, are probably fairly accurate. Mhm

71
00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.580
. So, I would imagine that pretty much everyone

72
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.028
lies some of the time and, and I'm not

73
00:04:03.038 --> 00:04:08.490
saying I'm not talking here about big massive deceptions or

74
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.778
anything like that. I mean, it's mostly,

75
00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:15.508
I would imagine like small white lies that don't cause

76
00:04:15.735 --> 00:04:17.254
damage at all, I would imagine. But let

77
00:04:17.264 --> 00:04:19.954
me actually ask you about that. So, should

78
00:04:19.963 --> 00:04:23.345
we, first of all, should we expect the

79
00:04:23.355 --> 00:04:27.553
people to be honest most of the time? And

80
00:04:27.564 --> 00:04:30.053
when they are dishonest? I mean, what are

81
00:04:30.064 --> 00:04:33.795
some of the most common ways people lie? Really

82
00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.048
? Yeah. And so we, we do find

83
00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:41.170
that most people are mostly on most of the time

84
00:04:41.178 --> 00:04:43.149
. And so, one of the ways that,

85
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.778
that we assess lying in, in our laboratory is

86
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.350
we, we ask people, how many lies have

87
00:04:48.358 --> 00:04:51.528
you told in the past 24 hours? And the

88
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.369
majority of people say zero and, and of those

89
00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:58.428
people who say they have told a lie, it

90
00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:00.000
tends to be pretty minimal, one lie or two

91
00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.509
lies. Um But we do have this subset of

92
00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:09.798
people that, that lie and extraordinarily uh lie extraordinarily

93
00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.709
uh frequently. Um And when we look at why

94
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.149
people lie, you're right. You know, these

95
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.329
tend not to be big lies. Most of the

96
00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:24.189
uh reasons that people give for lying are to avoid

97
00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.559
shame and embarrassment. So they're lying to save face

98
00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.079
essentially. And um and, and so people's deception

99
00:05:33.088 --> 00:05:38.829
tends not to be malicious. Uh uh Most of

100
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:42.738
the lying tends to be uh protecting themselves and people

101
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.319
lie for privacy sake. Um People also tell lies

102
00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:48.639
just to smooth over social interactions. And so,

103
00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:50.778
you know, when I come into the office and

104
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.379
one of my colleagues says, how are you doing

105
00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.149
today? Even if I'm not doing that that great

106
00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:00.139
, I'll say I'm doing fine. And it's because

107
00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:01.959
neither of us wants to have a difficult conversation about

108
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.500
my personal life struggles at that moment. You know

109
00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.209
, so we, we tell these uh these lies

110
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.869
pretty regularly just to allow uh social interactions to proceed

111
00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:16.829
smoothly and I might be wrong here. But isn't

112
00:06:16.838 --> 00:06:20.540
it also the case that uh a big chunk of

113
00:06:20.548 --> 00:06:25.019
the time when we lie? It's not actually uh

114
00:06:25.338 --> 00:06:30.319
uh really a straight uh straight out lying but mostly

115
00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:34.170
like omitting some information that people do not ask us

116
00:06:34.178 --> 00:06:38.250
directly. But perhaps we might think. Oh,

117
00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.119
ok. So perhaps if I were 100% honest,

118
00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:45.309
I should also make deciding not to do that something

119
00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.879
like that. Right. Yeah, that's, that's

120
00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:50.309
what we find is that, um, if most

121
00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:55.439
people wanna avoid giving honest answers, they will use

122
00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.250
the most morally defensible strategy possible. And, and

123
00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:00.850
the, the, the easiest one is just to

124
00:07:00.858 --> 00:07:04.689
avoid a topic entirely so different, then I don't

125
00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.350
need to talk to you about these, uh,

126
00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:10.720
unpleasant things that I don't wanna, um, that

127
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.670
I don't wanna discuss other ways that, that we

128
00:07:13.678 --> 00:07:18.389
can answer or respond dishonestly is by minimizing, um

129
00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:23.889
, by using vague language. And so most people

130
00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:26.379
will only use an outright lie as is the,

131
00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:30.119
the strategy of last resort because an outright lie is

132
00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:33.838
in most people's minds kind of morally indefensible. If

133
00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.298
you're caught in a lie, it, it,

134
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:40.579
it has some big, um, social repercussions and

135
00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:43.639
reputational repercussions. And so most of us will try

136
00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:45.798
to, um, find these, uh, uh

137
00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:49.579
, less grievous, uh, uh, strategies for

138
00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:53.910
being dishonest. Yeah. Basically some small ways of

139
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.869
circumventing, uh, total honesty. Right. Exactly

140
00:07:57.879 --> 00:08:01.439
. Exactly. Ok. So, a and using

141
00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:03.220
or referring to the title of one of your books

142
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.559
, the most recent one. Who are these big

143
00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:11.869
liars, what characterizes them? Well, when we

144
00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:16.329
, we've studied thousands of people in our studies and

145
00:08:16.338 --> 00:08:18.259
what we find consistently, as I mentioned earlier is

146
00:08:18.269 --> 00:08:22.329
most people are pretty honest, but there's this small

147
00:08:22.338 --> 00:08:28.170
subset that, that lies um extraordinarily. And so

148
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:30.730
when we're talking about big liars in the book,

149
00:08:30.738 --> 00:08:33.129
we talk about really kind of two groups of people

150
00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:37.719
, people who lie very frequently. Um But also

151
00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:43.269
um people who tell maybe fewer lies but lies that

152
00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:46.000
have massive consequences. And so when we look at

153
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.658
the types of people who tend to lie very frequently

154
00:08:50.668 --> 00:08:52.418
, we see some patterns. Um one is they

155
00:08:52.428 --> 00:08:56.580
turn um lying kind of peaks in late adolescence for

156
00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:01.149
most people and then declines across adulthood. And so

157
00:09:01.158 --> 00:09:05.070
younger people tend to lie more than older people.

158
00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:07.119
Um We've looked at gender differences and what we find

159
00:09:07.129 --> 00:09:11.908
is that men and women don't really lie differentially as

160
00:09:11.918 --> 00:09:13.859
far as frequency, men. I mean, there's

161
00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:16.798
a slight difference but it's, it's like 4% difference

162
00:09:16.808 --> 00:09:20.629
. It's pretty uh minor. But when we look

163
00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:22.308
at people who lie a lot, it's predominantly men

164
00:09:22.619 --> 00:09:24.288
. And so when we look at those people who

165
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.690
probably, you know, 10 or more lies a

166
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.960
day, uh the men, uh definitely outnumber um

167
00:09:31.969 --> 00:09:35.580
the women. And then there's other patterns that we

168
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.428
see um in personality traits. For example, we

169
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.019
see that um, self esteem is associated with lying

170
00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:46.940
. So people with low self esteem tend to lie

171
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.590
considerably more than people with higher self esteem. And

172
00:09:50.599 --> 00:09:52.639
that kind of tracks with, um, you know

173
00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:54.678
, some of the things I was talking about earlier

174
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.548
is people often lie out of a sense of shame

175
00:09:56.558 --> 00:10:01.090
or embarrassment, things like that. Um And then

176
00:10:01.099 --> 00:10:03.719
we also see some personality traits like the the dark

177
00:10:03.729 --> 00:10:09.428
triad personality traits like Machiavellian is and, and psychopathy

178
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.229
. So people who are kind of generally kind of

179
00:10:11.239 --> 00:10:16.200
nasty, manipulative people use dishonesty, um, more

180
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.058
often than people who don't, uh, have those

181
00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.359
personality traits. And then, you know, so

182
00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:22.168
, so those are some of the factors that are

183
00:10:22.178 --> 00:10:26.190
associated with being, uh, prolific liars or big

184
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.009
liars. Ok. So let's go through some of

185
00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:33.298
the differences there, break them down a little bit

186
00:10:33.308 --> 00:10:35.109
further. So, uh, you mentioned there,

187
00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:39.129
for example that, uh, generally speaking, there's

188
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.529
not a big difference in the rates of lying between

189
00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:45.690
men and women, but among the big liars,

190
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.750
most of them seem to be male. So,

191
00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:54.298
is there any explanation to for that? Well,

192
00:10:54.308 --> 00:10:56.629
when we, uh, when we look at,

193
00:10:56.029 --> 00:11:00.538
um, how some of these big liars operate,

194
00:11:00.548 --> 00:11:01.979
some of them are, um, more, uh

195
00:11:01.989 --> 00:11:07.090
, manipulative and they will kind of callously take advantage

196
00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.899
of others. And those traits are, are much

197
00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:13.298
more common in men than they are in women.

198
00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:16.109
Um, sort of status seeking is much higher in

199
00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:20.469
males um, and so it's, it's possible that

200
00:11:20.479 --> 00:11:22.399
those are actually the underlying traits that are, uh

201
00:11:22.408 --> 00:11:26.149
, more related to the lying rather than the,

202
00:11:26.158 --> 00:11:28.969
you know, the biological sex itself. It's these

203
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:31.099
, um, these traits that probably are to a

204
00:11:31.109 --> 00:11:35.250
certain degree socialized and probably to a certain degree,

205
00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:37.460
there's something, you know, different in our underlying

206
00:11:37.469 --> 00:11:41.038
biology that gives rise to these traits where males,

207
00:11:41.048 --> 00:11:43.840
more than females tend to outright, um, use

208
00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:46.889
outright manipulation as a technique to get ahead in the

209
00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:54.109
world. And what about uh some general biological differences

210
00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:56.139
? I mean, are there any notable biological differences

211
00:11:56.149 --> 00:12:03.359
between big liars and the general population? There's really

212
00:12:03.369 --> 00:12:07.239
limited research on this topic. Um There is um

213
00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:11.288
there has been some research looking at um a gray

214
00:12:11.298 --> 00:12:13.820
matter and white matter in the brain. So,

215
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.229
gray matter are essentially the the neurons and white matter

216
00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:22.558
are the pathways the myelinated axons. And um there's

217
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.969
some research suggesting that people who lie extraordinarily have uh

218
00:12:26.979 --> 00:12:31.750
more white matter to gray matter ratio than, than

219
00:12:31.808 --> 00:12:37.190
non prolific liars in the frontal lobe of the brain

220
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.038
. So this is the frontal lobe of the brain

221
00:12:39.048 --> 00:12:39.529
is, you know, one of the parts of

222
00:12:39.538 --> 00:12:45.590
the brain that are really essential for executive processes like

223
00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:48.849
um you know, plans making and things like that

224
00:12:48.239 --> 00:12:52.369
. And so there's been some speculation in the literature

225
00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:58.029
that um these differences and executive functioning processes due to

226
00:12:58.038 --> 00:13:03.840
differences in underlying biology might be relevant to these patterns

227
00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:05.090
that we see with some people lying less and some

228
00:13:05.099 --> 00:13:09.558
people lying more. Um, there's also evidence that

229
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.418
dishonesty is a heritable trait. So it's maybe it's

230
00:13:13.428 --> 00:13:18.000
coded in our genes to a certain extent. Um

231
00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:20.719
, and so the heritability is about 30% which means

232
00:13:20.729 --> 00:13:22.779
about may, maybe about 30% of the variability that

233
00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:26.779
we have and people's tendency to be honest is related

234
00:13:26.788 --> 00:13:28.349
to our underlying genes. And, um, and

235
00:13:28.359 --> 00:13:31.989
certainly there's heritability for things like, um, like

236
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.269
psychopathy and just that tendency to, you know,

237
00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:39.849
take advantage of others without having much remorse about it

238
00:13:39.859 --> 00:13:41.070
. So, so those, that's probably about the

239
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.779
extent that we can say anything, um, definitive

240
00:13:45.788 --> 00:13:50.000
about the underlying biology of being a big liar.

241
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.668
By the way, when it comes to possibly thinking

242
00:13:52.678 --> 00:13:56.940
about honesty as a trait as a personality trait,

243
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.908
I guess in this case, does it relate in

244
00:13:58.918 --> 00:14:03.440
any way to the exec personality traits? Because one

245
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.538
of them is honesty, humility. Is there any

246
00:14:05.548 --> 00:14:09.019
relationship there or, or not? Oh, sure

247
00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:11.239
. And that's one of the ways that we assess

248
00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.250
, you know, honesty and dishonesty is using the

249
00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:16.690
Hexaco traits. Um, we have a few other

250
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.288
measures of honesty and dishonesty. But, but,

251
00:14:18.298 --> 00:14:22.250
um, yeah, that, that broad personality trait

252
00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:24.658
, um, uh, is, um, is

253
00:14:24.668 --> 00:14:28.950
a principal measure that we use. And what about

254
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.869
culture and the context where people live in? Does

255
00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:39.070
that also play a role in shaping the differences between

256
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.700
big liars and the rest of the people. Uh

257
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:45.779
, it, it does. And we can,

258
00:14:46.548 --> 00:14:46.960
you know, when we think about culture, we

259
00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:50.219
can think about the, the very local level,

260
00:14:50.229 --> 00:14:52.349
like the, the family that someone lives in.

261
00:14:52.359 --> 00:14:56.889
There's great variability there. And, um, so

262
00:14:56.899 --> 00:15:00.690
I, I teach a seminar on Deception. I

263
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.750
talk with my students about the families they grow up

264
00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:07.389
in and there's, there's a wide range of,

265
00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:09.609
uh, of, um, styles, uh,

266
00:15:09.619 --> 00:15:13.489
and attitudes toward honesty and dishonesty that we see where

267
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:16.889
now some students who talk about their parents have raised

268
00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:18.369
them and told them if you can get ahead by

269
00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:20.308
lying, you should, you know, so they're

270
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.769
really almost encouraging. Um lying is a strategy.

271
00:15:26.308 --> 00:15:31.519
And we see that in families where um the parents

272
00:15:31.529 --> 00:15:35.320
are very punitive, um the Children tend to lie

273
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.369
a lot more, uh actually in families where uh

274
00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:41.928
a person just has siblings, they tend to lie

275
00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.629
a lot more. So there's something about sibling dynamics

276
00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:46.479
that might be relevant. But if we look at

277
00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:48.070
culture more broadly, what we do see is that

278
00:15:48.729 --> 00:15:52.580
, for example, across countries, there's different attitudes

279
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.469
about dishonesty and honesty and it's kind of uh really

280
00:15:56.479 --> 00:16:00.229
domain specific. And so for example, in some

281
00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:03.710
countries and certain um occupational fields, it's accepted to

282
00:16:03.719 --> 00:16:07.489
be dishonest and not in other fields. And so

283
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.129
, but very broadly, yeah, we do see

284
00:16:10.739 --> 00:16:14.869
um across countries, when we ask people about their

285
00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:17.808
tendency to lie in some countries, people lie a

286
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.619
lot more than in others. And it seems to

287
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:25.340
track, uh along with, um with broad social

288
00:16:25.349 --> 00:16:26.808
organizations. So in countries where there's a lot of

289
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.769
corruption, for example, the individuals in those countries

290
00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:33.769
tend to lie a lot more. And I guess

291
00:16:33.779 --> 00:16:36.869
that there are also cultures where, I mean,

292
00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:41.009
you're not allowed to express certain ideas or say certain

293
00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:45.798
things out of politeness and courtesy, I guess,

294
00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:48.989
like, for example, Japan and places like that

295
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.509
where there are things that people really feel very,

296
00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:55.830
very uneasy saying, but not, not, I

297
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.969
, I'm not sure if that's actual dishonesty because it's

298
00:16:59.979 --> 00:17:03.950
done out of politeness, courtesy and stuff like that

299
00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.588
. But I mean, perhaps from our point of

300
00:17:06.598 --> 00:17:11.078
view it would be dishonest in a way. Right

301
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.019
. Yeah, sure. You know, the,

302
00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:15.318
the, the taboos, um, uh, vary

303
00:17:15.328 --> 00:17:18.670
considerably from one culture to another. And so in

304
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.920
countries where there are a lot of taboo topics,

305
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.920
you'd expect there to be a lot of, um

306
00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.890
, less than fully honest communication. And we can

307
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.640
actually see that historically in western Europe, um,

308
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:36.199
how honesty and dishonesty has been treated and how it's

309
00:17:36.209 --> 00:17:40.299
been interpreted has changed considerably over like the past 500

310
00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:44.380
years. Um, and, uh, where at

311
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.848
certain times it would be considered deeply, deeply offensive

312
00:17:48.858 --> 00:17:51.189
to be honest. And so it was expected or

313
00:17:51.199 --> 00:17:53.328
encouraged to be dishonest. And we can see that

314
00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:56.568
even in, like, in the United States right

315
00:17:56.578 --> 00:18:00.289
now that, you know, Children are are taught

316
00:18:00.368 --> 00:18:03.890
not to uh express their true feelings about a gift

317
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.140
they've received. For example, if they receive a

318
00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.209
gift that they don't like, they're, they're uh

319
00:18:08.219 --> 00:18:12.348
indoctrinated into this uh style of, of acting as

320
00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:15.108
if they do like it and commenting about how much

321
00:18:15.118 --> 00:18:18.150
they enjoy it when they actually don't. Mhm.

322
00:18:18.689 --> 00:18:22.848
Does uh this kind of big lying, have anything

323
00:18:22.858 --> 00:18:30.618
to do with personal philosophies? Sure. Um we

324
00:18:30.338 --> 00:18:33.789
, we uh have a, a scale or a

325
00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:37.420
measurement that we use, um, fairly often that

326
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.368
assesses people's attitudes toward lying and it asks questions like

327
00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.630
, you know, it's ok to lie sometimes and

328
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.299
people strongly agree or strongly disagree. And what we

329
00:18:48.309 --> 00:18:52.868
see is that there's pretty wide variability in people's attitudes

330
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.189
about honesty and the importance of honesty. And some

331
00:18:56.199 --> 00:19:00.989
people see honesty is absolutely essential and they fret that

332
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.578
they're not being honest enough and other people have a

333
00:19:04.588 --> 00:19:11.088
more cavalier attitude about honesty or dishonesty and feel like

334
00:19:11.098 --> 00:19:15.910
dishonesty is necessary and there's nothing particularly wrong with it

335
00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:18.289
. And so they are much more apt to lie

336
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.469
. And, I mean, why is it,

337
00:19:22.479 --> 00:19:26.348
what motivates these big liars? Exactly. I mean

338
00:19:26.358 --> 00:19:33.338
, why do they lie so prolifically and monumentally sometimes

339
00:19:33.348 --> 00:19:37.279
, at least there's a lot of, uh,

340
00:19:37.289 --> 00:19:41.309
different reasons why people lie lying is really just a

341
00:19:41.318 --> 00:19:45.959
strategy that we use to, you know, achieve

342
00:19:45.969 --> 00:19:47.449
, uh, you know, that the outcomes that

343
00:19:47.459 --> 00:19:51.118
we want to experience. And so in some cases

344
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.848
, you know, people are wanting to facilitate social

345
00:19:53.858 --> 00:19:56.719
relationships. And so they lie in order to,

346
00:19:56.729 --> 00:20:00.180
you know, bond with people or feel a sense

347
00:20:00.189 --> 00:20:03.289
of connection with people. Um in other cases,

348
00:20:03.299 --> 00:20:06.578
people are trying to gain a financial advantage or a

349
00:20:06.588 --> 00:20:08.709
power advantage. And so they're lying for those reasons

350
00:20:08.719 --> 00:20:11.969
. So, um you know, the, the

351
00:20:11.979 --> 00:20:15.608
motivations for lying are as, as varied as the

352
00:20:15.618 --> 00:20:18.410
motivations for doing anything we do in the world.

353
00:20:18.759 --> 00:20:19.920
Um And so, you know, it's really kind

354
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:23.868
of hard to talk about why people lie or what

355
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.410
the motivations are because it's simply a tool that people

356
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.828
use. You know, and, and we,

357
00:20:29.838 --> 00:20:33.890
we have a, a lot of psychological manipulation tools

358
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.900
in our toolbox that help us achieve our goals.

359
00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:37.338
And at the end of the day, lying is

360
00:20:37.348 --> 00:20:41.930
just one of those. So getting into another possible

361
00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:47.509
aspect of what leads big liars to become a big

362
00:20:47.519 --> 00:20:49.769
liar. So, uh is there anything about uh

363
00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:56.130
developmental psychology? I mean, their childhood development that

364
00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.719
is special or not? Well, we see that

365
00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.729
um patterns of lying emerge early in life. And

366
00:21:04.739 --> 00:21:10.118
so in developmental psychology studies, we see that most

367
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.348
Children will start lying between the ages of two and

368
00:21:12.358 --> 00:21:15.759
three and they're usually not very good at it,

369
00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:19.689
they fumble around, they're not very convincing. Um

370
00:21:21.219 --> 00:21:22.449
Yeah, and, but as they get older,

371
00:21:22.459 --> 00:21:25.500
by the time Children are five or six, they're

372
00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:27.959
pretty good at, at telling lies that completely convince

373
00:21:27.969 --> 00:21:33.660
their parents for example. Um And so the trajectories

374
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:37.118
that we see is that most Children lie more and

375
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.380
more as they get older until they reach adolescence.

376
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.400
Um But then we see this kind of break in

377
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.209
the trajectories where most, for most people, their

378
00:21:45.219 --> 00:21:48.618
lying tends to, um start to decline at that

379
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.338
point. And one of the reasons is that there

380
00:21:52.348 --> 00:21:56.598
are pretty harsh, uh, social and reputational consequences

381
00:21:56.608 --> 00:22:00.019
for being known as a liar. And so we've

382
00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:03.180
probably all had experiences where we've been caught in a

383
00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:07.078
lie. And so people start to learn that there

384
00:22:07.088 --> 00:22:11.019
are more uh socially productive ways to get what we

385
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:12.368
want other than lying. And so that, that

386
00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.140
trajectory is they tend to um lie less. But

387
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.588
for some Children, that trajectory just uh keeps on

388
00:22:18.598 --> 00:22:22.709
in, in an upward direction. And so,

389
00:22:22.719 --> 00:22:25.650
uh we can start to see these patterns of who

390
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.809
are going to be the big liars and who aren't

391
00:22:26.818 --> 00:22:30.769
pretty early on when we look at like pathological liars

392
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.549
and we interview them and we ask them, you

393
00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:37.219
know, when their lying first became really problematic in

394
00:22:37.229 --> 00:22:40.509
their lives, for the vast majority of them is

395
00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:45.068
during adolescence, a and in the book, you

396
00:22:45.078 --> 00:22:48.150
talk about different types of liars, like for example

397
00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.430
, storytellers, exaggerators, pathological liars. And we'll

398
00:22:52.439 --> 00:22:56.739
come back to the pathological liars specifically later on in

399
00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.588
our conversation and also psychopath. So, uh are

400
00:23:00.598 --> 00:23:03.890
these all different kinds of big liars? And if

401
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:10.539
so what distinguishes them from one another. Well,

402
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:12.209
the, uh, the, the, they are

403
00:23:12.219 --> 00:23:15.059
all liars and, and they're, yeah, I'd

404
00:23:15.068 --> 00:23:18.930
say they're different types and essentially there are different motivations

405
00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:23.269
for them all. Um, the storytellers and exaggerators

406
00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:26.519
. These are people who are primarily, uh,

407
00:23:26.529 --> 00:23:30.358
telling lies because they like the positive attention that comes

408
00:23:30.368 --> 00:23:34.189
their way when they're telling these exaggerated outrageous stories.

409
00:23:34.199 --> 00:23:37.049
So, you know, I, I grew up

410
00:23:37.059 --> 00:23:38.059
, uh, down the street from a person who

411
00:23:38.068 --> 00:23:41.880
told, told wild stories all the time and I

412
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.680
think everyone knew that they were alive, but they

413
00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:48.118
were just so outrageous that we couldn't turn away.

414
00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:49.430
And so, uh so I think some people,

415
00:23:49.439 --> 00:23:53.469
some storytellers uh that is their motivation is that,

416
00:23:53.479 --> 00:23:56.219
that warm glow of attention when they're, when they're

417
00:23:56.229 --> 00:24:02.140
um saying these outrageous things, um uh path,

418
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.818
uh the psychopaths. On the other hand, these

419
00:24:03.828 --> 00:24:10.259
are people that, you know, callously and remorselessly

420
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:12.729
use others and, and take advantage of others to

421
00:24:12.739 --> 00:24:17.519
get what they want. And so their motivation is

422
00:24:17.529 --> 00:24:21.608
to treat other people as just mere objects or pawns

423
00:24:21.618 --> 00:24:23.309
in their game to get what they want in the

424
00:24:23.318 --> 00:24:27.640
world. And so they have a much more selfish

425
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:33.250
and self serving ambitions and goals and uh that disregard

426
00:24:33.259 --> 00:24:36.420
of the, the rights and welfare of others.

427
00:24:36.719 --> 00:24:37.900
And so, you know, you can kind of

428
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.959
see the, the big distinction there. But then

429
00:24:40.969 --> 00:24:41.769
I, as I mentioned earlier, we also have

430
00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:48.118
people who lie considerably, um because they they believe

431
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.400
themselves to be inadequate. And so they're, you

432
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.890
know, have this um painfully low self esteem where

433
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.039
they feel like they're just never measuring up. And

434
00:24:59.049 --> 00:25:00.598
the only way they can feel good about themselves is

435
00:25:00.608 --> 00:25:03.539
to present a false version of themselves to the rest

436
00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:07.578
of the world. A and so I, I

437
00:25:07.588 --> 00:25:10.269
mean, there are in the book, you mentioned

438
00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:14.838
several different occupations where we find some big liars,

439
00:25:14.848 --> 00:25:18.750
but before getting into the occupations themselves, le legitimate

440
00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:22.660
occupations in this case, what about scam artists?

441
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.630
Is there anything special about them? You know?

442
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.618
Uh I, I don't know if there's anything special

443
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.588
about them, although they, they tend to have

444
00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:36.670
psychopathic traits that is, they, they tend to

445
00:25:36.828 --> 00:25:40.809
not have a lot of empathic regard for others.

446
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.279
Um but they, they also are really good at

447
00:25:44.289 --> 00:25:48.098
justifying their bad behavior and um and we're all good

448
00:25:48.108 --> 00:25:51.949
at justifying our bad behavior, but they tend to

449
00:25:51.959 --> 00:25:56.670
be pretty exceptional at it where they tend to have

450
00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.390
a philosophy or a belief that uh what they're doing

451
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.920
isn't really all that bad. And so I'm not

452
00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.920
really harming someone because they have plenty of money or

453
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.680
they would do the exact same thing to me if

454
00:26:10.689 --> 00:26:11.979
they could. Therefore, it's fine for me to

455
00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:15.549
do it to them. And so when we look

456
00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:19.219
at um and scam artists and, and other criminals

457
00:26:19.229 --> 00:26:22.150
for that matter, they tend to be pretty adept

458
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.400
at finding justifications for their own behavior. I think

459
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.279
most of us do that to a certain degree.

460
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:33.239
But we, we get to a line where we

461
00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.500
eventually have this self-recognition that I'm being a bad person

462
00:26:37.509 --> 00:26:40.618
. I'm being the type of person I don't wanna

463
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.848
be and it prevents us from, from carrying out

464
00:26:42.858 --> 00:26:48.519
too many um uh too many awful things. A

465
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:52.380
and so there are certain occupations that you talk about

466
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:56.709
in the book where people, uh I mean,

467
00:26:56.719 --> 00:27:00.338
there are sanctioned lies there uh or some frequent sanctioned

468
00:27:00.348 --> 00:27:03.289
lies like for example, in the case of lawyers

469
00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:07.170
, doctors and politicians. So, uh I mean

470
00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.709
, is it the case that perhaps in these kinds

471
00:27:10.719 --> 00:27:15.338
of occupations, we find a higher proportion of uh

472
00:27:15.348 --> 00:27:18.430
quote unquote big liars than in the general population.

473
00:27:18.439 --> 00:27:25.779
And uh and if so why we, we do

474
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:27.640
and I guess I don't wanna lump all these occupations

475
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.150
in together when talking about this. Uh you know

476
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.660
, for example, when we, when we look

477
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:36.660
at uh uh physicians, um most of them report

478
00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:40.328
that they're not fully honest with their patients. And

479
00:27:40.338 --> 00:27:41.709
so they'll do things like they report that they're,

480
00:27:41.789 --> 00:27:47.989
they give overly optimistic uh prognoses uh for their very

481
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.750
ill patients in order for their patients to have more

482
00:27:49.759 --> 00:27:52.358
hope. And so this is really kind of a

483
00:27:52.368 --> 00:27:56.568
benevolent lie. Like the, the doctors are lying

484
00:27:56.578 --> 00:27:57.930
for their own sake, they're lying for the sake

485
00:27:57.939 --> 00:28:02.719
of their patients. Um And usually they're not even

486
00:28:02.729 --> 00:28:03.939
outright lies. It's kind of like, as we

487
00:28:03.949 --> 00:28:06.949
talked about before, we can minimize, we can

488
00:28:06.959 --> 00:28:08.809
just not talk about certain things. And, um

489
00:28:08.818 --> 00:28:11.880
, but when we look at, um, in

490
00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:15.559
, in, in the field of sales, for

491
00:28:15.568 --> 00:28:18.400
example, what we find is that, you know

492
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.949
, lying or being dishonest, maybe not lying,

493
00:28:21.959 --> 00:28:25.209
um, necessarily, but being dishonest is oftentimes,

494
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:27.920
uh, an important trait and it's actually valued by

495
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.559
employers, you know, and so, uh,

496
00:28:30.568 --> 00:28:36.920
if you're trying to sell an inferior product at the

497
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.279
same price as a superior project, that's an impossible

498
00:28:40.289 --> 00:28:41.229
task if you're being honest all the time. And

499
00:28:41.239 --> 00:28:45.640
so we need to exaggerate advantages and minimize flaws and

500
00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:48.868
things like that. And in, in politics,

501
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.699
what we find is that, you know, people

502
00:28:52.989 --> 00:28:55.118
, when we ask people, what, in what

503
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.838
fields are people more honest or dishonest. People tend

504
00:28:57.848 --> 00:29:02.750
to, um, tend to list politics as being

505
00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:04.150
uh a field in which people are most dishonest.

506
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.459
And there's some truth to that. Um, politicians

507
00:29:07.469 --> 00:29:11.199
are placed in a difficult position of trying to please

508
00:29:11.209 --> 00:29:15.469
a broad constituency where people have different, uh goals

509
00:29:15.479 --> 00:29:18.380
and wants and needs. And so trying to please

510
00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.880
everyone is difficult to do if you're being honest all

511
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.108
the time. But what we find is that politicians

512
00:29:25.618 --> 00:29:27.989
, uh politics is in a field is not a

513
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.640
field where dishonest people, um enter that field,

514
00:29:33.098 --> 00:29:36.818
the people who enter politics are just as honest as

515
00:29:36.828 --> 00:29:38.779
, um any other person in the general population.

516
00:29:40.108 --> 00:29:44.500
What we see is that once people enter into politics

517
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:47.180
, the pressures are put on them where they find

518
00:29:47.189 --> 00:29:49.818
that they need to become dishonest. And in fact

519
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.439
, um, there's some research in Western Europe showing

520
00:29:53.449 --> 00:29:57.309
that politicians who are willing to lie are much more

521
00:29:57.318 --> 00:30:00.729
likely to be re-elected than politicians who are unwilling to

522
00:30:00.739 --> 00:30:03.949
lie. So, uh, so it might be

523
00:30:03.959 --> 00:30:07.578
that the field itself, um, molds people into

524
00:30:07.588 --> 00:30:11.150
being big liars. So it seems that at least

525
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:15.509
in some uh some prominent occupations, uh being dishonest

526
00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:21.068
, uh gets you places. Right. Absolutely.

527
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.358
So let me ask you about one particular topic now

528
00:30:26.368 --> 00:30:30.989
. So people also sometimes lie in relationships but particularly

529
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.219
in romantic relationships. So why do people lie in

530
00:30:37.229 --> 00:30:41.140
those cases specifically? I mean, what are their

531
00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:47.789
motivations and what do they usually lie about what they

532
00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:51.059
lie about? And their motivations probably depends a lot

533
00:30:51.068 --> 00:30:53.118
on the, the phase of the relationship. And

534
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.299
so there's a lot of research on um kind of

535
00:30:57.309 --> 00:31:00.769
the, the initial phases, the dating phase of

536
00:31:00.779 --> 00:31:04.920
relationships. And um looking at online dating websites,

537
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.539
for example, both men and women tend to be

538
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:12.838
uh fairly dishonest when they're describing themselves, their attitudes

539
00:31:12.848 --> 00:31:15.479
, their history. And essentially, you know,

540
00:31:15.608 --> 00:31:18.199
if we're on the dating market, we're trying to

541
00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:21.439
make the best case for ourselves. We, we're

542
00:31:21.449 --> 00:31:23.259
trying to market ourselves and the way that we pull

543
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:29.000
that off is exaggerating positives and minimizing, minimizing negative

544
00:31:29.009 --> 00:31:33.930
traits. And so, um for example, men

545
00:31:33.939 --> 00:31:37.578
know that women, uh, oftentimes have a,

546
00:31:37.588 --> 00:31:41.459
a particular height standard that they're looking for in prospective

547
00:31:41.469 --> 00:31:44.358
mates. And so men tend to exaggerate how tall

548
00:31:44.368 --> 00:31:47.039
they are. They also tend to exaggerate, um

549
00:31:47.049 --> 00:31:48.920
, the, the, the status or the,

550
00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.509
uh, of their, uh, profession or the

551
00:31:52.519 --> 00:31:55.469
amount of income they have and things like that and

552
00:31:55.479 --> 00:31:56.098
, and women do the same thing just, uh

553
00:31:56.118 --> 00:31:59.709
, you know, they lie about things that are

554
00:31:59.719 --> 00:32:02.108
being selected on, um, by, by,

555
00:32:02.118 --> 00:32:05.709
um, people who are looking at them as mates

556
00:32:06.439 --> 00:32:09.769
. Um Now once you get into established relationships,

557
00:32:10.189 --> 00:32:14.098
um, the, you know, the, the

558
00:32:14.108 --> 00:32:16.130
, the tension around, uh, uh uh those

559
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.170
, um, types of traits are probably much less

560
00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.430
. And so the topics that people lie about start

561
00:32:22.439 --> 00:32:24.598
to differ. Um What we find is that men

562
00:32:24.608 --> 00:32:28.719
and women in relationships do lie to each other even

563
00:32:28.729 --> 00:32:31.199
in well established relationships. But the, the lies

564
00:32:31.209 --> 00:32:36.779
tend to be focused on maintaining uh peace and harmony

565
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:39.500
in the relationship. And so people will, will

566
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:44.920
lie in order to prevent a fight from emerging or

567
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.039
, but they also lie for benevolent reasons, um

568
00:32:47.049 --> 00:32:51.269
, to boost the sen the sense of self esteem

569
00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:53.130
and their partners. Um And so the, the

570
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.598
lies tend to be more supportive in nature, but

571
00:32:57.608 --> 00:33:00.680
certainly when people are doing bad things in relationships,

572
00:33:00.689 --> 00:33:01.309
they'll lie about it. So, you know,

573
00:33:01.318 --> 00:33:05.598
people lie about their Infidelities and, and, um

574
00:33:05.608 --> 00:33:07.250
, you know, drug habits and things like that

575
00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.598
. Um But again, you know, their,

576
00:33:09.608 --> 00:33:12.618
what their, what their ultimate goal is, is

577
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.838
to try to preserve their relationship and they're using lies

578
00:33:15.848 --> 00:33:17.779
to make that happen. But we've, we've studied

579
00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:22.489
lies within the context of people's sexual relationships as well

580
00:33:22.078 --> 00:33:25.338
. And what we found in those cases is that

581
00:33:25.779 --> 00:33:29.670
the, the majority of the reasons that people are

582
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.500
lying in the context of their sex lives is to

583
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:35.180
make their partners feel better. So they, they

584
00:33:35.189 --> 00:33:38.900
feign enthusiasm and they, they lie about the fact

585
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:42.299
that they're, you know, also thinking about other

586
00:33:42.309 --> 00:33:44.930
people and, and things like that, but the

587
00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.670
, the goal that they, um are trying to

588
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.630
achieve, at least their self reported goal is to

589
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.189
try to make the experience more pleasant for their partners

590
00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:59.880
. And what about familial relationships and friendships? Because

591
00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:02.759
sometimes people also lie in those contexts, right.

592
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:08.719
Yeah, absolutely. Um, we, we see

593
00:34:08.728 --> 00:34:13.389
in, in adolescence, for example, the people

594
00:34:13.398 --> 00:34:15.260
they lie to most is their friends. We thought

595
00:34:15.269 --> 00:34:17.829
it'd be parents but it's their, their friends.

596
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.050
And, um, and when we look at why

597
00:34:22.059 --> 00:34:23.219
they're lying, it's, it's oftentimes, you know

598
00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:25.559
, getting back to this idea of they're trying to

599
00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:30.340
save face, they're trying to present themselves as being

600
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:31.849
, you know, more desirable as, as uh

601
00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:36.599
friends than perhaps they feel like they are. But

602
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:38.719
when we look at adult in adults, um people

603
00:34:38.728 --> 00:34:42.639
tend to be pretty honest with their close friends.

604
00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:45.378
Um, you know, all of us have this

605
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:49.438
, uh, this, this desire to present genuine

606
00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:52.780
versions of ourselves to people who will accept us.

607
00:34:52.789 --> 00:34:54.789
And when we have those close friendships with people,

608
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:58.610
we tend to seek them as the, the outlets

609
00:34:58.619 --> 00:35:00.010
where we'll be most honest about who we are and

610
00:35:00.019 --> 00:35:02.590
what we're thinking and, and our wants and desires

611
00:35:02.599 --> 00:35:06.958
and so forth. Mhm. And I, I

612
00:35:06.969 --> 00:35:08.489
mean, talking, uh, a little bit since

613
00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:13.079
we're talking about relationships, getting a little bit into

614
00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.389
some of the negative aspects and consequences of lying in

615
00:35:16.398 --> 00:35:20.840
this context. So what are the ways by which

616
00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:27.489
social relationships get fractured by deception? Well, you

617
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.769
know, trust is, uh, is really,

618
00:35:31.188 --> 00:35:34.969
uh, can be difficult to build and it takes

619
00:35:34.978 --> 00:35:37.128
time to build like to us. Like if you

620
00:35:37.139 --> 00:35:38.938
just imagine the person who you trust more than anyone

621
00:35:38.949 --> 00:35:42.648
in the world, the reason you trust them is

622
00:35:42.929 --> 00:35:46.639
they've established this very long track record of being honest

623
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:50.869
and, and being a, a trustworthy partner.

624
00:35:51.269 --> 00:35:53.398
Um, but it's also very easy to fracture that

625
00:35:53.409 --> 00:35:55.708
trust. You know, just one lie can,

626
00:35:55.958 --> 00:35:59.909
uh, undo all of the, the trust that's

627
00:35:59.918 --> 00:36:04.438
been built up over years, but we do treat

628
00:36:04.728 --> 00:36:07.070
lies differently. And so not all lies are,

629
00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:12.159
are given the same moral weight and, or ethical

630
00:36:12.168 --> 00:36:16.010
weight. And so when within relationships, for example

631
00:36:16.019 --> 00:36:19.228
, if people find that someone has told a white

632
00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:21.659
lie, they tend to overlook that and it doesn't

633
00:36:21.668 --> 00:36:24.409
really damage the trust. However, if someone is

634
00:36:24.418 --> 00:36:28.708
caught telling a selfish lie where they're taking advantage of

635
00:36:28.719 --> 00:36:30.260
their close partner, then, then obviously that's gonna

636
00:36:30.269 --> 00:36:34.360
fracture the trust and, uh, you know,

637
00:36:34.369 --> 00:36:36.369
and, and in some cases, the, the

638
00:36:36.378 --> 00:36:38.820
trust is fractured to such a degree that it's impossible

639
00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:42.628
to rebuild. Um, if we look at,

640
00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:45.148
you know, within friendships, but we can also

641
00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:47.239
look more broadly at trust. We can, we

642
00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:52.269
can see that the amount of trust between people varies

643
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.429
quite a bit from one location to another, from

644
00:36:54.438 --> 00:36:58.110
one country to another or one society to another.

645
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.079
Um, uh, there's a, a book out

646
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:04.119
that, uh, that covers, uh, distrust

647
00:37:04.128 --> 00:37:07.789
within a small Romanian village where essentially no one trusts

648
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.889
each other. And it's, it's really remarkable how

649
00:37:12.898 --> 00:37:15.610
, um, how different that, so that society

650
00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:19.989
operates when you only can really count on a small

651
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.590
handful of people and everyone else is essentially viewed as

652
00:37:22.599 --> 00:37:25.889
a danger or a threat. And so, but

653
00:37:25.898 --> 00:37:28.219
by the way, by the way, just one

654
00:37:28.228 --> 00:37:30.889
second, the book you're talking about is living with

655
00:37:30.898 --> 00:37:34.809
distrust by Rabu Umbridge. That's correct. That's correct

656
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.510
. Yeah. Yeah, I, I've had him

657
00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:37.769
on my show. So, yeah, it's,

658
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.478
it's, it sounded familiar. Yeah. Yeah.

659
00:37:42.668 --> 00:37:45.579
So it's really remarkable when you read about what it's

660
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.699
like to live in a deeply distrustful society compared to

661
00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:52.050
a trustful one. It's, uh, it's much

662
00:37:52.059 --> 00:37:55.110
more challenging. Yeah. And so, I mean

663
00:37:55.119 --> 00:38:00.619
, are there any specific cases where perhaps people might

664
00:38:00.628 --> 00:38:05.599
need interventions to reduce lying in relationships? And if

665
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:10.780
so, are there those kinds of interventions. Yes

666
00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:14.329
. Uh There are people, I get emails from

667
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:20.059
people at least weekly um explaining that they're lying or

668
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.579
their partners lying or their children's lying is causing massive

669
00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.728
problems within their relationships and they're asking me for help

670
00:38:27.739 --> 00:38:30.438
. So there's, there's certainly people who experience lying

671
00:38:30.449 --> 00:38:34.228
is out of control and in need of some uh

672
00:38:34.239 --> 00:38:38.139
change. And uh I think fortunately the, the

673
00:38:38.148 --> 00:38:45.458
um standard um tools that we have for psychological intervention

674
00:38:45.949 --> 00:38:50.369
for other types of problems are pretty um effective for

675
00:38:50.378 --> 00:38:52.918
helping people deal with lying, standard cognitive behavior,

676
00:38:52.929 --> 00:38:55.228
therapies. For example, you know, a lot

677
00:38:55.239 --> 00:39:00.208
of the reasons that people lie is um because of

678
00:39:00.219 --> 00:39:02.699
how they're thinking about the world and, and what

679
00:39:02.708 --> 00:39:06.639
they're seeing is there options for interacting with people and

680
00:39:06.648 --> 00:39:09.260
we can help people cultivate tools to find different strategies

681
00:39:09.269 --> 00:39:12.878
for getting the same things they're trying to achieve.

682
00:39:14.168 --> 00:39:16.869
So going, getting back to the big liars,

683
00:39:16.878 --> 00:39:21.188
I would like to uh hear a little bit more

684
00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:23.219
about, let's say they, their models operandi.

685
00:39:23.389 --> 00:39:28.320
So how do they get away with their lies?

686
00:39:28.329 --> 00:39:32.510
Exactly. Do they usually resort to particular strategies or

687
00:39:32.519 --> 00:39:36.389
tactics or how, how do they go about it

688
00:39:37.889 --> 00:39:39.989
? We've, we've interviewed a lot of people about

689
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.429
their strategies for lying. Um And it's pretty interesting

690
00:39:45.438 --> 00:39:50.228
because we all have ideas about how liars behave.

691
00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:52.878
And so when we ask uh people, you know

692
00:39:52.889 --> 00:39:54.510
, what, what are liars look like? Like

693
00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:57.539
how can you tell if someone's lying, they say

694
00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.909
, well, liars, avoid eye contact and liars

695
00:40:00.918 --> 00:40:02.769
fidget a lot. And liars touch their face and

696
00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:07.510
liars, stutter and stammer. But when we ask

697
00:40:07.519 --> 00:40:10.969
liars how they tell convincing lies, they essentially do

698
00:40:10.978 --> 00:40:14.409
the opposite of those things. They say, I

699
00:40:14.418 --> 00:40:16.409
make eye contact. I try not to fidget.

700
00:40:16.418 --> 00:40:20.909
I try not to stutter and stammer. Um So

701
00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.809
those are some of the techniques that they use is

702
00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.090
, um, is just to try to look normal

703
00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:28.208
is what most of them say. And so we

704
00:40:28.219 --> 00:40:30.909
have a, a sense of what our normal behavior

705
00:40:30.918 --> 00:40:32.289
looks like. And so we can just try to

706
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.010
continue to engage in that normal looking behavior when we're

707
00:40:37.019 --> 00:40:42.070
telling lies, another strategy that um the big liars

708
00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:45.989
report using is to plan their lies. So if

709
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.219
they know that the topic is gonna come up,

710
00:40:47.228 --> 00:40:51.530
they plan in advance what they're gonna say. Um

711
00:40:51.539 --> 00:40:54.139
And they also plan the types of details that they're

712
00:40:54.148 --> 00:40:58.719
gonna reveal and the ones they won't reveal. And

713
00:40:58.728 --> 00:41:00.860
, and oftentimes a strategy, a strategy that they

714
00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:04.878
use is to bury a lie within a cloud of

715
00:41:04.889 --> 00:41:06.860
truth. So I can tell you a story that

716
00:41:06.869 --> 00:41:08.159
is almost entirely truthful. And then there's just this

717
00:41:08.168 --> 00:41:12.438
one lie and that makes it difficult to detect when

718
00:41:12.449 --> 00:41:17.030
most of what I'm saying is coherent and consistent with

719
00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:20.668
the information that you already know. And so it

720
00:41:20.679 --> 00:41:22.849
appears truthful and then I just hide that one lie

721
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.510
within the midst of it, by the way,

722
00:41:25.519 --> 00:41:31.679
are people generally good at lie detection? No,

723
00:41:32.239 --> 00:41:37.208
they're not. They're actually pretty poor at lie detection

724
00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:38.610
. Um And so the way that we study,

725
00:41:38.619 --> 00:41:42.550
uh, you know, how good people are detecting

726
00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:46.360
lies is we, we typically record videos of people

727
00:41:46.369 --> 00:41:50.369
who are lying or telling the truth. And then

728
00:41:50.378 --> 00:41:52.250
we show these videos to participants in our study and

729
00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.110
we just ask them to identify who are the liars

730
00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:58.090
and who are the people who are being honest.

731
00:41:58.889 --> 00:42:00.590
And in a lot of these studies, half of

732
00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:04.079
the videos are of liars and half of them are

733
00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.320
telling the truth. And we find that people are

734
00:42:07.329 --> 00:42:12.059
, their accuracy rates are around 54% where, you

735
00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:15.349
know, you get 50% accuracy just flipping a coin

736
00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.789
. And what this suggests is that people are really

737
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:22.840
, really poor lie detectors and in the, in

738
00:42:22.849 --> 00:42:25.110
the cases where they do detect liars, it tends

739
00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:29.139
to be because some people just aren't very good liars

740
00:42:29.148 --> 00:42:30.469
. There are some people who, when they're telling

741
00:42:30.478 --> 00:42:32.679
a lie, it's just kind of obvious. But

742
00:42:32.688 --> 00:42:36.469
those are the minority of people, the vast majority

743
00:42:36.478 --> 00:42:39.978
of people are, is concerned when they're lying or

744
00:42:39.989 --> 00:42:44.199
being honest just by looking at their body language or

745
00:42:44.208 --> 00:42:45.750
listening to their tone of speech and things like that

746
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.128
. So, so to answer your question, yeah

747
00:42:47.139 --> 00:42:51.989
, people are not very good uh lie detecting and

748
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.929
uh as a person who studies lying, I'm aware

749
00:42:53.938 --> 00:42:57.188
of that myself. Uh, in my classes,

750
00:42:57.199 --> 00:43:00.559
we do activities where people tell lies and tell the

751
00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:01.918
truth and I'm no better than the average person.

752
00:43:01.929 --> 00:43:05.909
And we actually see that in, uh, in

753
00:43:05.929 --> 00:43:08.219
, you know, professions where people are, you

754
00:43:08.228 --> 00:43:09.909
know, part of their job is to, to

755
00:43:09.918 --> 00:43:14.409
, to detect lying, like with police interrogators and

756
00:43:14.418 --> 00:43:16.668
things like that. They are no better than college

757
00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:21.409
students that watching these videos and figuring out who's lying

758
00:43:21.418 --> 00:43:24.219
, who's telling the truth. And so how are

759
00:43:24.228 --> 00:43:29.878
most lies detected when they are detected? I mean

760
00:43:29.889 --> 00:43:32.728
, what makes for uh what, what leads to

761
00:43:32.739 --> 00:43:38.949
someone really uncovering a lie? Usually, you know

762
00:43:38.958 --> 00:43:43.340
, the, the primary way in the, in

763
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:45.739
the way we study this is we just ask people

764
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.579
like think of the last time you detected that someone

765
00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.780
was lying. How did you figure it out?

766
00:43:51.369 --> 00:43:54.079
Um What we find is that almost no one says

767
00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:58.398
, oh, they fidgeted or they weren't making eye

768
00:43:58.409 --> 00:44:00.639
contact, what they, what they talk about is

769
00:44:00.648 --> 00:44:02.300
evidence that they uncovered. So they say, oh

770
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:06.619
, this person said something, it was inconsistent with

771
00:44:06.628 --> 00:44:09.289
this other fact that I already knew about or they'll

772
00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:14.898
report that they had third party information. So my

773
00:44:14.909 --> 00:44:16.789
, you know, my romantic partner said they were

774
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.610
at this party, but I talked to people with

775
00:44:19.619 --> 00:44:21.409
the who were at the party and they said,

776
00:44:21.418 --> 00:44:22.648
you know, my romantic partner wasn't there at all

777
00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:25.938
. And so, so that's how people tend to

778
00:44:25.949 --> 00:44:30.449
discover lies that um most lies go undiscovered. Uh

779
00:44:30.458 --> 00:44:34.510
When we ask people about their lying and we ask

780
00:44:34.519 --> 00:44:37.668
them what proportion of your lies get discovered. They

781
00:44:37.679 --> 00:44:39.750
say it's a very, very small minority of lies

782
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.110
that get discovered. I think part of that is

783
00:44:43.458 --> 00:44:46.559
we don't really care if someone tells me if I

784
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.168
say, how are you doing? And they say

785
00:44:49.179 --> 00:44:51.929
I'm doing fine. I don't really care if they're

786
00:44:51.938 --> 00:44:53.050
not doing fine. I mean, in, in

787
00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:54.969
the sense where I'm gonna try and dig deeper and

788
00:44:54.978 --> 00:44:58.250
find out if they're lying. It's only in really

789
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:04.898
consequential situations where we realize someone's motivations might be at

790
00:45:04.909 --> 00:45:07.579
odds with ours. And the outcome of them being

791
00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:12.619
honest versus dishonest has um uh a, a deeply

792
00:45:12.628 --> 00:45:15.559
profound effect on me. In those cases, I'll

793
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:17.869
start digging and looking for additional information and, and

794
00:45:17.878 --> 00:45:22.019
even trying to solicit confessions and things like that.

795
00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:24.579
Um So, uh that's, that tends to be

796
00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:29.260
how we uncover lying is by digging deeper. And

797
00:45:29.269 --> 00:45:35.728
two big liars themselves use particular strategies to avoid detection

798
00:45:37.378 --> 00:45:38.239
. Yeah. What we find is that the people

799
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:42.398
who are good liars tend to be really good actors

800
00:45:42.409 --> 00:45:45.829
that is they can feign emotions very well. Um

801
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.719
And they, they are also very good at controlling

802
00:45:49.728 --> 00:45:53.059
details and so they're very um selective and how they

803
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:58.070
present information. Um but they tend to present themselves

804
00:45:58.079 --> 00:46:01.119
as friendly, confident, engaged with the person who

805
00:46:01.128 --> 00:46:06.208
they're talking to and they concoct when they do concoct

806
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.789
lies, the lies tend to be very plausible and

807
00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.010
they present them in a way where they found where

808
00:46:12.019 --> 00:46:15.739
they sound very certain. And so, uh,

809
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.628
earlier when we talked about relationships, I, I

810
00:46:17.639 --> 00:46:22.728
asked you what sort of, uh, consequences might

811
00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:27.789
lying have on different kinds of social relationships. What

812
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.929
about the effects that big liars can, there can

813
00:46:30.938 --> 00:46:36.789
have both on themselves and on society more generally?

814
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.329
Well, when we, um, look at the

815
00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.110
effect it has on themselves and we, when we

816
00:46:43.119 --> 00:46:45.369
talk to people, uh like pathological liars, like

817
00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:49.889
they feel awful like they, they come to us

818
00:46:49.898 --> 00:46:52.800
and, and, and want help because they feel

819
00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.289
like their lives are unfolding or they feel like they

820
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:58.398
just, uh you know, can't be genuine with

821
00:46:58.409 --> 00:47:00.590
anyone anymore. And so there's, you know,

822
00:47:00.599 --> 00:47:05.389
some pretty good evidence that when people lie a lot

823
00:47:05.398 --> 00:47:07.309
, they, they actually have neg negative outcomes for

824
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.148
themselves in a lot of ways. But, you

825
00:47:10.159 --> 00:47:14.050
know, when we look at, um, you

826
00:47:14.059 --> 00:47:15.909
know, the effects that big liars have on society

827
00:47:15.918 --> 00:47:19.489
more broadly, you know, they, they,

828
00:47:19.679 --> 00:47:22.269
you know, lying in other forms of uh dishonesty

829
00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:27.168
lead to, you know, billions of dollars and

830
00:47:27.179 --> 00:47:30.869
fraud every year. And so there's this massive societal

831
00:47:30.878 --> 00:47:32.039
consequence and, you know, even when we look

832
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:36.769
at politics, you know, when people, um

833
00:47:36.809 --> 00:47:39.860
, um you know, develop this deep mistrust for

834
00:47:39.869 --> 00:47:44.878
politicians that it, you know, gravely alter society

835
00:47:44.889 --> 00:47:46.110
in a lot of ways. And so, so

836
00:47:46.119 --> 00:47:49.938
, yeah, uh you know, certainly lying can

837
00:47:49.949 --> 00:47:52.898
affect the individual, but the consequence of the lying

838
00:47:52.909 --> 00:47:55.699
permeates out into society and causes all sorts of mayhem

839
00:47:57.599 --> 00:48:00.789
. Uh And so we've been referring to pathological liars

840
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:06.340
throughout our conversation, but what characterizes them? Exactly

841
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:07.579
. And I mean, is this some sort of

842
00:48:07.679 --> 00:48:14.070
a clinical diagnosis or not? So, yeah,

843
00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:15.789
we wrote a book that was published last year on

844
00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.800
a pathological lying and the, the reason we,

845
00:48:19.989 --> 00:48:22.199
and I'm talking about when I say we uh my

846
00:48:22.208 --> 00:48:24.628
colleague uh Drew Curtis and I um have been doing

847
00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:29.648
a lot of this research on pathological lying. And

848
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.478
we're interested in that because it's a topic that is

849
00:48:32.489 --> 00:48:35.610
, you know, familiar in our vernacular. We

850
00:48:35.619 --> 00:48:37.389
talk about pathological lying all the time when we use

851
00:48:37.398 --> 00:48:39.260
the term people seem to know what we mean.

852
00:48:39.269 --> 00:48:44.570
But um there hadn't been any consistent research on this

853
00:48:44.579 --> 00:48:47.369
topic. The first people that the first researchers that

854
00:48:47.378 --> 00:48:51.199
looked at pathological lying were doing research on it over

855
00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:54.090
100 years ago. Um But there hasn't been a

856
00:48:54.099 --> 00:48:59.708
consistent definition of what the term means. And so

857
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:02.239
in our review of the literature, we found 17

858
00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:07.449
different definitions of pathological lying that have been used over

859
00:49:07.458 --> 00:49:10.969
the decades and there's a lot of inconsistency. Um

860
00:49:12.539 --> 00:49:15.699
And so when we started talking about pathological lying,

861
00:49:15.708 --> 00:49:17.659
we started thinking of it in the, the context

862
00:49:17.668 --> 00:49:22.280
of the way that we um identify other mental health

863
00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:28.679
disorders. So, pathology or psychopathology like anxiety disorders

864
00:49:28.688 --> 00:49:30.878
and mood disorders like depression. When we're talking about

865
00:49:30.889 --> 00:49:35.019
those, we tend to um think of the,

866
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:38.539
the person as um having some uh adjustment problems in

867
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:44.159
their relationships or in the workplace. They're also experiencing

868
00:49:44.289 --> 00:49:47.159
discomfort and distress around this, this problem that they're

869
00:49:47.168 --> 00:49:52.188
having. Um and of oftentimes the disorder puts them

870
00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:55.010
at some sort of risk, uh you know,

871
00:49:55.019 --> 00:49:58.978
um sometimes it's risk of, of injury or death

872
00:49:58.989 --> 00:50:00.820
and sometimes it's risk of like incarceration and things like

873
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:04.610
that. And so when we started thinking about pathological

874
00:50:04.619 --> 00:50:06.329
lying, we put it in that framework. So

875
00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.929
we talked about, we define pathological lying as um

876
00:50:09.938 --> 00:50:15.059
a a pattern of excessive lying. That's oftentimes compulsive

877
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.360
in nature, it causes disruption in people's lives,

878
00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:21.760
it causes them to experience distress and oftentimes puts them

879
00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:23.750
at, at risk. Uh But I mean,

880
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:29.780
in terms of, let's say disease classification, is

881
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:34.309
there any category specific category for this kind of uh

882
00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:39.139
behavior that does it have any specific name or term

883
00:50:39.148 --> 00:50:42.510
in, for example, the DS M or,

884
00:50:42.519 --> 00:50:45.728
or, or elsewhere? Yeah. So in the

885
00:50:45.739 --> 00:50:46.728
United States, we use the DS M or the

886
00:50:46.739 --> 00:50:52.860
diagnostic and statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association.

887
00:50:52.869 --> 00:50:54.688
And that's basically the, the book in which every

888
00:50:54.719 --> 00:51:00.309
recognized mental health disorder is listed along with the diagnostic

889
00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:05.289
criteria. And pathological lying isn't listed as a um

890
00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.530
a diagnosis in, in that manual. Um it's

891
00:51:08.539 --> 00:51:12.429
listed as a, as a, a symptom of

892
00:51:12.438 --> 00:51:15.898
a few disorders, but uh like personality disorders.

893
00:51:15.909 --> 00:51:17.978
Uh for example, but, but not as a

894
00:51:17.989 --> 00:51:21.800
disorder in and of itself. So my colleague Drew

895
00:51:21.809 --> 00:51:23.829
Curtis is currently doing a lot of work to more

896
00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.110
better represent pathological lying. And he's doing some good

897
00:51:28.119 --> 00:51:31.659
work showing that some people exhibit pathological lying in the

898
00:51:31.668 --> 00:51:36.019
absence of any mental health disorder, any other mental

899
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:38.389
health diagnosis which suggests maybe it is a stand alone

900
00:51:38.398 --> 00:51:43.458
condition and should be recognized as a stand alone um

901
00:51:43.469 --> 00:51:45.550
diagnosis. Mhm. And, and I mean,

902
00:51:45.559 --> 00:51:51.570
if it would be recognized as a stand alone diagnosis

903
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.530
, would you have, for example, a set

904
00:51:52.539 --> 00:51:58.809
of criteria for diagnosing someone as a pathological liar?

905
00:52:00.708 --> 00:52:02.590
Yeah. So uh and we're, we're working on

906
00:52:02.599 --> 00:52:07.378
some diagnostic tools right now. So we have a

907
00:52:07.389 --> 00:52:10.829
uh uh a diagnostic self report measure um that uh

908
00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.820
is about to be published right now. It's under

909
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:16.079
review at a journal. And um and so we've

910
00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:20.239
done a lot of work validating it showing that people

911
00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:22.148
who seem to meet these criteria that we've set out

912
00:52:22.159 --> 00:52:27.329
for pathological lying have poorer life outcomes, like they're

913
00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:30.030
more likely to have problems in their relationships, problems

914
00:52:30.039 --> 00:52:32.329
at work and so forth. They also um report

915
00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:37.628
higher levels of emotional distress on these different psychological measures

916
00:52:37.639 --> 00:52:39.239
that we've used to validate it. They also have

917
00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:43.789
this lifelong pattern of pathological lying. So the lying

918
00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.840
isn't just a, a response to a specific event

919
00:52:45.849 --> 00:52:49.019
in their life. And so, yeah, there

920
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:52.789
does seem to be some consistency with the way that

921
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.369
we're defining it and the uh the, the symptoms

922
00:52:55.378 --> 00:53:00.000
and outcomes of these pathological liars are exhibiting. But

923
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.260
in this particular case, since you're labeling it,

924
00:53:01.269 --> 00:53:07.159
pathological lying, should we assume that people would have

925
00:53:07.168 --> 00:53:10.550
this condition when it's classified as a condition that they

926
00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:15.260
have no control over it, that they basically cannot

927
00:53:15.269 --> 00:53:19.070
help themselves if they don't get any sort of treatment

928
00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:22.239
or something like that. you know, that's that

929
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:23.878
, that kind of gets down to, you know

930
00:53:23.889 --> 00:53:28.000
, deeper questions around free will and things like that

931
00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:30.719
. So to say that someone has no control over

932
00:53:30.728 --> 00:53:32.378
something I think is a, a bit of a

933
00:53:32.389 --> 00:53:35.750
stretch like we have control over, you know,

934
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.800
most things in our lives, but the, the

935
00:53:37.809 --> 00:53:42.360
difficulty we face controlling things like as someone who is

936
00:53:42.369 --> 00:53:45.648
uh uh addicted to smoking cigarettes, they, they

937
00:53:45.659 --> 00:53:47.878
have control but they find that control very challenging.

938
00:53:49.148 --> 00:53:51.239
And so I think the goal that we have as

939
00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:55.179
psychologists is to offer people who are having difficulties controlling

940
00:53:55.329 --> 00:54:00.800
um coping mechanisms and strategies to help them better control

941
00:54:00.809 --> 00:54:05.010
uh those behaviors that they're trying to reduce. Uh

942
00:54:05.019 --> 00:54:07.789
And if this turns out to be a condition in

943
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:12.208
and of itself, uh do you expect it to

944
00:54:12.539 --> 00:54:15.010
uh uh do you expect that we will be able

945
00:54:15.019 --> 00:54:16.418
to treat it somehow? I mean, are there

946
00:54:16.429 --> 00:54:21.550
, for example, already any tools at our disposal

947
00:54:21.559 --> 00:54:24.500
to deal with other conditions where perhaps some of them

948
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:29.510
might even have pathological lying as one of the criteria

949
00:54:29.519 --> 00:54:32.489
for diagnosis that would also or could also apply here

950
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:35.769
. Yeah, I believe so. And I,

951
00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.228
I mentioned earlier in our conversation, um, cognitive

952
00:54:38.239 --> 00:54:43.869
behavior therapy has, has demonstrated some effectiveness. And

953
00:54:43.878 --> 00:54:46.329
so essentially what we're doing with that therapy is we're

954
00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:51.809
helping people change their beliefs and their attitudes about things

955
00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:52.728
that are going on in their lives and the hope

956
00:54:52.739 --> 00:54:57.070
that those changes and beliefs will lead to changes in

957
00:54:57.079 --> 00:55:00.500
behavior. There's also some evidence that um you know

958
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:05.599
, some pharmaceutical treatments might be effective um to help

959
00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:09.369
with like kind of compulsive behaviors um and anxiety as

960
00:55:09.378 --> 00:55:13.208
well. But all of this research is very,

961
00:55:13.219 --> 00:55:15.949
very preliminary. And so, uh my colleague,

962
00:55:15.958 --> 00:55:19.978
Doctor Curtis is, is uh starting to do some

963
00:55:19.989 --> 00:55:22.500
work trying to validate some of these treatments, but

964
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.469
it's difficult because in order to, to carry out

965
00:55:24.478 --> 00:55:27.989
these days, you have to find a large enough

966
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.860
group of pathological liars. And so it's pretty a

967
00:55:30.869 --> 00:55:32.398
pretty slow process. But, you know, we

968
00:55:32.409 --> 00:55:37.829
do have people um coming through his laboratory that uh

969
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:40.519
we're beginning some of this research on. So let

970
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:44.840
me just ask you one last question earlier, we

971
00:55:44.849 --> 00:55:49.590
mentioned here how people usually are not very good at

972
00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:53.418
lie detection, but are there perhaps some scientifically validated

973
00:55:53.429 --> 00:55:58.905
ways that people can avoid being by liars? I

974
00:55:58.914 --> 00:56:00.804
mean, at least perhaps some things that people try

975
00:56:00.813 --> 00:56:06.103
to might try to pay attention to some strategies that

976
00:56:06.114 --> 00:56:07.014
they might use, like, for example, I'm

977
00:56:07.023 --> 00:56:12.184
not asking people particular things or paying attention to this

978
00:56:12.195 --> 00:56:14.414
or that, I mean, is there something like

979
00:56:14.425 --> 00:56:17.489
that or not? Yeah. Um I think the

980
00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.849
, the principal technique is to, or the principal

981
00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:28.208
strategy is just to recognize when another person's motives are

982
00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:30.599
in conflict with your own. And that's when we

983
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:34.128
tend to see dishonesty um occurring. And so just

984
00:56:34.139 --> 00:56:37.760
recognizing when that's happening is important, um but then

985
00:56:37.769 --> 00:56:43.969
we can also use strategies uh that include digging deeper

986
00:56:43.978 --> 00:56:47.119
for information. And so uh one strategy I use

987
00:56:47.128 --> 00:56:49.590
, I I, I'm a professor, so I

988
00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.878
have students lying to me all the time. And

989
00:56:51.889 --> 00:56:54.550
so I'll ask them for more details about their story

990
00:56:54.559 --> 00:56:57.958
and sometimes they'll, you know, report details that

991
00:56:57.969 --> 00:57:00.168
are in conflict with something I already know, or

992
00:57:00.179 --> 00:57:04.159
they'll report details that are in conflict with something they've

993
00:57:04.168 --> 00:57:07.469
previously stated. And then another strategy is to have

994
00:57:07.478 --> 00:57:10.269
people retell stories. And sometimes if it's a fabricated

995
00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.878
story, when they retell it, the details will

996
00:57:13.889 --> 00:57:17.550
change. Um But primarily what, what I look

997
00:57:17.559 --> 00:57:22.349
for is uh inconsistencies and when you see inconsistencies,

998
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.168
that's when you, you know, you might wanna

999
00:57:24.179 --> 00:57:29.300
dig a bit deeper. Um and then sometimes,

1000
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:31.849
uh you know, just asking for honesty is effective

1001
00:57:31.918 --> 00:57:34.610
, you know, if we suspect someone is being

1002
00:57:34.619 --> 00:57:38.519
dishonest, just simply uh soliciting a confession saying,

1003
00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:39.898
like, look, I know that this is a

1004
00:57:39.909 --> 00:57:43.389
hard thing to talk about but it's really important for

1005
00:57:43.398 --> 00:57:45.030
me that we have an honest conversation here. Can

1006
00:57:45.039 --> 00:57:46.878
you just give me the honest answer? And I'll

1007
00:57:46.889 --> 00:57:50.409
accept that uh what we find is that a lot

1008
00:57:50.418 --> 00:57:52.300
of people will just confess at that point. And

1009
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:55.559
so really checking facts though is the, is the

1010
00:57:55.570 --> 00:58:00.110
, the key way. There's no uh secret uh

1011
00:58:00.119 --> 00:58:01.639
technique that you know, that, you know,

1012
00:58:01.648 --> 00:58:06.679
Sherlock Holmes uses other than looking for the evidence.

1013
00:58:06.688 --> 00:58:08.070
And so, so that's what we focus on.

1014
00:58:08.719 --> 00:58:12.438
Great. So, Doctor Hart, let's send on

1015
00:58:12.449 --> 00:58:15.688
that note then and just to mention the books again

1016
00:58:15.699 --> 00:58:17.418
, the latest one, big liars, what psychological

1017
00:58:17.429 --> 00:58:21.329
science tells us about lying and how you can avoid

1018
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:23.889
being duped. And the other one, pathological lying

1019
00:58:23.898 --> 00:58:27.809
theory, research and practice. I'm leaving links to

1020
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:30.378
them in the description box of this interview. And

1021
00:58:30.389 --> 00:58:31.909
apart from the books, would you like also to

1022
00:58:31.918 --> 00:58:35.708
tell people where they can find you and your work

1023
00:58:35.719 --> 00:58:38.728
on the internet? Uh They can uh find me

1024
00:58:38.739 --> 00:58:44.510
at my uh my website um at Christian O heart.com

1025
00:58:44.728 --> 00:58:47.199
and uh and then on my academic website. Um

1026
00:58:47.208 --> 00:58:50.289
But uh yeah, thanks so much for having me

1027
00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.789
on the show. I've really enjoyed the conversation.

1028
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.039
