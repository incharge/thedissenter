00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.230
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.110
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:08.939
today I'm joined by Doctor Sean Gallagher. He is

4
00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.840
the Lillian and MRI Moss, Professor of Excellence at

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.609
the University of Memphis. His areas of research include

6
00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.760
phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences. And today we're talking

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.399
about his latest book, The Self And Its Disorders.

8
00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:27.049
So, Doctor Gallagher, welcome to the show. It's a

9
00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.569
huge pleasure to everyone.

10
00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.510
Thank you very much, Ricardo. Nice, nice to be

11
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.840
here.

12
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.409
So my first question would be, could you please

13
00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:40.880
start by telling us what the book is actually

14
00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:43.439
about? I mean, I'm going to read a quote

15
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.810
from your book here that I think I would

16
00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.090
like. Uh IT'S very nice to get into what

17
00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:52.310
the book is really about and I would like

18
00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.619
you to comment on it. So there continues to

19
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.520
be a strong movement toward transforming psychiatry into neuropsychiatry.

20
00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.779
So, would you like to comment on that and

21
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.779
tell us a little bit about what the book

22
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.019
is actually about?

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.480
OK, I think maybe uh that, that is uh

24
00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:18.529
something like an overgeneralization because I mean, psychiatry is

25
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.500
a very broad um area of research and practice.

26
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.699
And uh I think maybe on the research side,

27
00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.069
there is uh quite a move to uh towards

28
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.540
this kind of uh focus on the brain and

29
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.629
neural processes. Uh Whereas I'm not sure that's the

30
00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:42.260
case. On the clinical side, I think on the

31
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.279
clinical side, people are much more pragmatic and trying

32
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.050
to, to work out the best uh approach to

33
00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:54.580
a particular patient. Uh AND they have uh they

34
00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:57.410
have ways of uh of, of doing that uh

35
00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:01.889
different uh different therapeutic approaches and maybe have a,

36
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.419
a large tool bag of what they can do.

37
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.050
And uh they don't necessarily think of it just,

38
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.669
just purely in terms of brain processes. Although having

39
00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:14.789
said that there are some people who still uh

40
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.399
focus on uh just getting the right medication and,

41
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.919
and then that's all we have to do because

42
00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:25.389
that will fix the brain, so to speak. Um

43
00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.889
So, uh the book itself is uh in a

44
00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:32.669
certain way, an attempt to provide an alternative um

45
00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:38.520
way of thinking about the subject, the the patient

46
00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:42.029
um in, in terms of this notion of a

47
00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.960
self pattern, which I think uh gives a uh

48
00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:50.580
an alternative approach to, to thinking about things, especially

49
00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.589
in the clinic, but also in, in the, on

50
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.669
the research side. Um And uh is uh I

51
00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.470
think it's clear from the book that uh it's

52
00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:06.059
very much inspired by embodied types of approaches to

53
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.020
cognition. So four e and inactive approaches especially

54
00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.309
so, so I'm going to ask you about each

55
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.229
of the points you made there, particularly the kind

56
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.559
of approach you present in the book based on

57
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.190
for e cognition. But just before we get into

58
00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.000
that, uh there's also another sort of comment you

59
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:33.139
make in the book about psychiatry generally, when you

60
00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:37.410
say that psychiatry and science even more generally, is

61
00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:43.419
not independent of epistemological and metaphysical assumption. So what

62
00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.339
does that mean? And why does that matter?

63
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.460
Yes. Well, I think that uh it a lot

64
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.039
depends on how you think of the mind. You

65
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.970
know what, what your conception of the mind is.

66
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.899
And uh that involves not only understanding how, for

67
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.339
example, we might access the mind mind of others

68
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.850
as well as our own mind. Um And those

69
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.480
are epistemological questions. Uh BUT also the very nature

70
00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:20.540
of what, what we consider to be the mind.

71
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.250
And uh those are metaphysical questions. Uh So if

72
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.929
we think of the mind simply as uh the

73
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.630
result of brain processes, and then that's going to

74
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.700
dictate a certain approach within psychiatry. Uh IF we

75
00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:41.290
think of the mind uh more in terms of

76
00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:46.760
embodied processes, uh extended processes, more in terms of

77
00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.369
uh bodily and environmental factors uh playing a role

78
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.130
in the constitution of the mind. Uh Then we

79
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.260
have a different, a different concept and uh that

80
00:04:56.269 --> 00:05:00.119
should have also implications for the practice of uh

81
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.890
psychiatry and how we do our research. Um So

82
00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:09.149
those are issues having to do with epistemological and

83
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.600
metaphysical um concerns and uh uh I think uh

84
00:05:15.609 --> 00:05:20.940
they, they play directly into uh questions about treatment

85
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.640
and uh and uh how we go about understanding

86
00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:26.790
other people. Mhm

87
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.040
So tell us then about the four E cognition

88
00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:35.739
approach and four E is stands for uh um

89
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.119
the mind being embodied, embedded, enacted and extended. So,

90
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.190
tell us about that and what are some of

91
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.040
the main ways it differs from other more dominant

92
00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:50.279
approaches in psychiatry?

93
00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:56.429
Yeah. So, um for, for, well, let me, let

94
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.570
me sort of say, first of all that, uh

95
00:05:58.579 --> 00:06:05.000
there's no uh uh complete consensus about what we

96
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.339
mean by embodiment or uh precisely what the four

97
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.010
es uh there's no agreement, you know, among all

98
00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.559
of the proponents of uh of four E cognition.

99
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.700
Um So, it's, it itself is a kind of

100
00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:25.220
complex area of research um that still involves ongoing

101
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.649
debates about the role of the body, the role

102
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.679
of the environment and so forth. Um So having

103
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.100
said that, I think uh there is some agreement

104
00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:38.519
that uh that what we're talking about here is

105
00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:41.359
not just a set of brain processes, but that

106
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:45.260
although the brain is an important factor, an important

107
00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:47.880
element in this story, uh we have to think

108
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.899
in terms of brain, body and environment as, as

109
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.700
a kind of uh unit of explanation. Uh And

110
00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:03.339
that opening up of, of the uh the kind

111
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.589
of explanatory scope uh of what, what it might

112
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.290
be, in fact uh causing uh the uh the

113
00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:15.910
condition that we're looking at, say in a psychiatric

114
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.950
condition that uh uh I think is useful. And

115
00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:23.209
uh that's part of what I'm, I'm trying to

116
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.839
argue that we take a four E approach. Then

117
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.640
we're looking not just at what's going on in

118
00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:30.910
the brain, not just what's going on in the

119
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.529
body, not just the environmental features, but um a

120
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.480
whole plurality of different factors that can enter in

121
00:07:38.489 --> 00:07:43.559
and uh uh can be helpful in our attempt

122
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.899
to explain what, what might be going on in

123
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.000
any particular person.

124
00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:53.260
So, something that you're also interested in is phenomenology

125
00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:58.750
and referencing. Again, my first question, when I mentioned

126
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.410
neuropsychiatry at a certain point in the book, you

127
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.640
say that the psychiatry should go beyond neurobiological factors

128
00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:15.130
and include phenomenological social existential dimensions. Uh What do

129
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.589
those dimensions correspond to exactly?

130
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.450
Well, uh I mean, uh the core idea in,

131
00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:29.609
in the phenomenological approach to psychiatry is that the

132
00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:34.010
uh one's experience really does matter first person experience,

133
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.409
um how we perceive the world, how we perceive

134
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.919
others, how we perceive ourselves. Um And our, our

135
00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:47.530
experiential um the experiential components of, of uh our

136
00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:54.900
uh our life. So uh taking that as something

137
00:08:54.909 --> 00:09:01.669
important to consider um the, the relationship between um

138
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.580
our, our own experience and all kinds of other

139
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.809
things going on, right? Uh OUR ability to reflect,

140
00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:16.200
for example, on our uh on our experience that

141
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.619
at least on some accounts that, that involves this

142
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:25.390
kind of existential component. Um And uh our ability

143
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.880
to relate to others may in fact be uh

144
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:34.679
shaped by how we experience uh our, our own

145
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:38.450
emotional life. Um So all of these factors are

146
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.080
uh interplay and all of these factors are uh

147
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:47.489
things uh where problems may develop. Uh WE might

148
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.700
develop some problem in emotion regulation and that's going

149
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.159
to affect our experience, which the phenomenon is trying

150
00:09:56.169 --> 00:09:58.809
to understand. Uh And that's going to affect our

151
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.140
relations with others uh and our, our ability to

152
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.260
cope with various things that we encounter in the

153
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.409
world. Um So phenomenology is one way into uh

154
00:10:11.419 --> 00:10:15.809
this kind of complex order of uh of the

155
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.330
of, of the individual self.

156
00:10:19.669 --> 00:10:22.109
So I would like to ask you now about

157
00:10:22.119 --> 00:10:28.299
some uh perhaps conceptual issues, theoretical issues in psychiatry

158
00:10:28.309 --> 00:10:32.969
that even uh among psychiatrists who come from other,

159
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.549
let's say school of schools of thought also argue

160
00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:40.750
among them. So, one of them is uh the

161
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.390
notion of symptom. So what does, what is the

162
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.289
symptom in psychiatry? Really?

163
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:54.070
OK. Um I think the, the notion of symptom

164
00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:01.690
is um in some cases, it's something like a

165
00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:07.179
uh the actual problem to be resolved or a

166
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.950
description of the problem. Uh And in in other

167
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.030
cases, it's taken to be uh a sign that

168
00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:17.960
uh motivates us to look elsewhere for the problem.

169
00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:21.299
Say. Um So, for example, if you, if you

170
00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:26.969
think of anxiety, um then uh is anxiety the

171
00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:30.380
problem um that, that someone is suffering from or

172
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.989
is it the uh is it the symptom of

173
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.849
something else? Um And we can always ask, uh

174
00:11:37.859 --> 00:11:42.729
you know, what causes the symptom. Um uh And

175
00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:45.250
then the question is, does that, you know, to

176
00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:48.789
talk about just, just to talk about symptoms? Uh

177
00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:51.890
IS that sufficient or do we have to look

178
00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:56.599
uh further for some kind of uh causal factors

179
00:11:56.609 --> 00:12:00.250
that will explain why the person is experiencing something

180
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:05.190
the way they are experiencing it. Um So, uh

181
00:12:05.369 --> 00:12:09.000
the, there is a, you know, the, uh a

182
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.409
network theory um that basically focuses on symptoms, uh

183
00:12:13.419 --> 00:12:16.150
talk, talking about a network of symptoms that will

184
00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:21.229
define the disorder. Um And one could ask, does

185
00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:24.630
that go deep enough? And, and there are debates

186
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.590
about this about to what extent we need to

187
00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:31.580
have something like a mechanistic explanation of what's going

188
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:38.010
on uh or causal um uh explanation. Um So,

189
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.059
if we think of uh the, the problem at

190
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.010
the level of sort of the uh uh the,

191
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.849
the causal factors, uh then um that seems to

192
00:12:48.859 --> 00:12:52.770
go just beyond symptoms, all those symptoms themselves can

193
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.460
have uh uh uh a kind of uh causal

194
00:12:56.469 --> 00:12:59.570
effect uh kind of looping back, you know, if,

195
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.409
if our symptom um has something to do with

196
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.969
um the stress we're experiencing and we start to

197
00:13:06.979 --> 00:13:10.080
feel anxiety that anxiety will then feed back into

198
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.280
itself and uh that will, will lead to uh

199
00:13:13.289 --> 00:13:18.140
even uh maybe further symptoms like insomnia or, or

200
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:22.919
whatever. Um So I guess, uh it's, uh I

201
00:13:22.929 --> 00:13:25.150
guess I would just say it's very complex, what

202
00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:28.080
a, what a symptom is, what role it plays

203
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.000
in uh in uh in psychiatry. And there are

204
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.640
different, different views about that.

205
00:13:36.059 --> 00:13:40.640
And what about the notion of mental disorder? Uh

206
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.229
What uh I mean, uh o of sure, of

207
00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:46.960
course, uh asking you what it means. Uh IF

208
00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:50.349
I ask different psychiatrists, I know that they would

209
00:13:50.359 --> 00:13:53.570
give me different answers because I've actually done that

210
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.960
on the show before. But uh how important do

211
00:13:56.969 --> 00:14:01.640
you think it is to uh understand or approach

212
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.960
this notion of mental disorder in psychiatry?

213
00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:13.299
Yeah. So, um I, I use the term uh

214
00:14:13.309 --> 00:14:18.750
and the idea of a disorder, I mean, literally

215
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.109
a disorder uh means that something that should be

216
00:14:22.119 --> 00:14:26.869
ordered is no longer ordered. Um And of course,

217
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.429
I'm thinking of this. Uh And, and you're absolutely

218
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.099
right that there are debates within psychiatry about now,

219
00:14:33.109 --> 00:14:35.679
you know how we should think about a mental

220
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.239
disorder or what exactly it is. Uh I think

221
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.280
of it as a, a disorder of the self

222
00:14:41.289 --> 00:14:45.400
pattern, right? So I'm using this pattern theory approach.

223
00:14:45.619 --> 00:14:49.000
Uh It's a disorder of the self pattern. You

224
00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:54.390
normally the, the uh the self pattern is and

225
00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:00.080
ordering of different factors. And the question, I guess

226
00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.609
the real question is what, you know, how do

227
00:15:02.619 --> 00:15:07.280
you judge something uh to be, say a, a

228
00:15:07.289 --> 00:15:14.070
disorder rather than a kind of ordinary ordering? And

229
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.580
uh it seems to me that the, the ultimate

230
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.309
uh sort of uh criterion here is whether the

231
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:26.950
person uh is experiencing a kind of suffering. So

232
00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:30.789
I think I would tie disorder to uh the

233
00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:36.359
idea of suffering. Uh And uh if you know,

234
00:15:36.369 --> 00:15:40.210
whatever the, the condition might be, if there's suffering

235
00:15:40.219 --> 00:15:43.280
involved, then we would say something is disordered, something

236
00:15:43.289 --> 00:15:47.359
needs to be set, right? Um What, what exactly

237
00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:50.130
that means setting something right is of course, then

238
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.880
open again to debate. But, but if, if um

239
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.059
if you can define it in terms of rel

240
00:15:56.159 --> 00:15:59.440
the relief of suffering, then, then you're moving in

241
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.159
the right direction. It seems to me.

242
00:16:02.609 --> 00:16:06.909
So I've asked you about symptoms about mental disorders.

243
00:16:06.919 --> 00:16:11.030
And according to at least the current neurology or

244
00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:15.049
the classification of psychiatric disorders that we have in

245
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.349
the DS M and elsewhere, there's a lots of

246
00:16:19.359 --> 00:16:24.880
overlap uh between different disorders in terms of the

247
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.979
symptoms that, that they share. What does that tell

248
00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:30.229
us if anything

249
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.469
we uh yes. Well, this uh the similarity of

250
00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:39.349
symptoms across different disorders. This has to do with

251
00:16:39.359 --> 00:16:44.409
comorbidity um that uh you know, patients can suffer

252
00:16:44.419 --> 00:16:50.609
all kinds of things that don't neatly fall into

253
00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:57.429
the kind of uh categories or classifications um of,

254
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:02.750
of uh the, you know, typical psychiatric disorders. Um

255
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.589
So, uh that, that of course, complicates things uh

256
00:17:07.598 --> 00:17:13.890
for uh for psychiatry. Um But if, if your

257
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:19.069
main concern is to, to make sure that we

258
00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:23.618
have the right classification um in order to determine

259
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:30.069
treatment, for example, um then yeah, then the the

260
00:17:30.469 --> 00:17:34.579
the kind of similarity of symptoms and the comorbidities

261
00:17:34.589 --> 00:17:38.510
are really complicating factors. If on the other hand,

262
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.829
you're focused on the patient, on or on, on

263
00:17:41.839 --> 00:17:48.609
the person uh and asking about the particular order

264
00:17:48.619 --> 00:17:53.650
of various factors that constitute the self pattern. Um

265
00:17:53.859 --> 00:17:56.819
Then it, it doesn't seem to be so much

266
00:17:56.829 --> 00:18:00.189
of a problem. Um The, you know, we could

267
00:18:00.199 --> 00:18:04.010
just say, well, this, this particular person uh is

268
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:10.920
manifesting um uh the uh uh this particular mix

269
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:15.359
of uh of symptoms. Uh uh AND well, it

270
00:18:15.369 --> 00:18:18.650
might be difficult to classify them, but nonetheless, this

271
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.189
is what the person is suffering. So let's let's

272
00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:25.270
focus on that and simply work out some kind

273
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.569
of therapeutic uh approach that would, that will hopefully

274
00:18:28.579 --> 00:18:31.400
work. Um So I think it's not so much

275
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.099
uh a problem in uh for, for the kind

276
00:18:36.109 --> 00:18:39.060
of approach that I'm proposing. Um IT does seem

277
00:18:39.069 --> 00:18:41.119
to be a problem when you're trying to really

278
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.479
be rigid about your classifications. Mhm

279
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:51.479
So, uh how would the classification of psychiatric disorders

280
00:18:51.489 --> 00:18:57.020
look like uh within the framework you present in

281
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:57.680
the book.

282
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.579
Yeah. Um, WELL, I suppose that I would say

283
00:19:05.589 --> 00:19:11.160
that, um, the, the, uh, in the notion of

284
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:16.119
self pattern, it's, uh again, not so important to,

285
00:19:16.729 --> 00:19:20.280
uh, to, to make sure that the classification is,

286
00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:24.270
is uh uh correct. There might be other reasons

287
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.359
why you, you'd want to have the correct classification

288
00:19:27.369 --> 00:19:29.280
and that might have to do with the whole

289
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:33.949
system uh of, you know, how people are, uh

290
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.959
are, are treated uh uh within certain practices and

291
00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:44.630
institutions and how medical research is funded and, and

292
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.219
so forth and so on. Uh So there might

293
00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:49.939
be practical reasons for that, but in terms of,

294
00:19:50.619 --> 00:19:55.119
um especially in terms of clinical practice, um I

295
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:59.469
don't think that matters as much uh still uh

296
00:19:59.479 --> 00:20:02.839
in, in terms of the uh the self pattern.

297
00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:08.130
Um I it's, it's not ever going to be,

298
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.530
you know, merely one thing that goes wrong. Uh

299
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:18.130
It's, it's going to be a, uh uh a,

300
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:21.359
a uh uh uh uh well, it's going to

301
00:20:21.369 --> 00:20:24.189
be a number of different factors that are going

302
00:20:24.199 --> 00:20:29.270
to be involved um, and trying to get straight

303
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.300
about exactly what those factors are and how they

304
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:37.300
are uh disordered, let's say, uh is uh part

305
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.520
of what you're, what you're aiming at, I think

306
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:42.020
in, in the clinical practice. Mhm.

307
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:46.560
So, uh I'm going to ask you about the

308
00:20:46.569 --> 00:20:50.239
self, self pattern and all of those notions that

309
00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.319
you also explore in the book. But just before

310
00:20:53.329 --> 00:20:57.020
that, just to cover uh one particular kind of

311
00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.739
approach that sometimes people have to mental disorder. There

312
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.500
are some people that say, or claim that mental

313
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:08.839
disorder is nothing but a social construct or that

314
00:21:08.849 --> 00:21:12.550
is it is merely a social construct. Uh What

315
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.260
do you make of that claim?

316
00:21:16.089 --> 00:21:19.310
Yeah. So I I would take that to be

317
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:23.099
something of a reductionist approach. Uh Any, any approach

318
00:21:23.109 --> 00:21:27.790
that just says uh oh mental disorder is just

319
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.709
this one thing, one thing goes wrong or, or,

320
00:21:31.719 --> 00:21:34.189
or there's one area that we just have to

321
00:21:34.199 --> 00:21:36.989
consider in order to explain everything. Now, that could

322
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.079
be, it's, it's a matter of just, just the

323
00:21:40.089 --> 00:21:44.770
brain or it's a matter of just social relations.

324
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:49.739
Um And it's totally socially constructed. Um I think

325
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.939
that what, what I'm arguing in the book is

326
00:21:52.949 --> 00:21:56.359
that, that, that would uh uh in fact be

327
00:21:56.369 --> 00:22:00.420
a kind of reductionist view and I'm arguing for

328
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:03.579
a, a non reductionist view which says, uh it's

329
00:22:03.589 --> 00:22:07.310
always going to involve um more than one thing.

330
00:22:07.989 --> 00:22:10.410
So the, the notion of the self pattern is

331
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.130
such that if you, if you um if you

332
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:18.949
change or intervene on one aspect and that, that

333
00:22:19.209 --> 00:22:22.130
uh does some kind of, that involves some kind

334
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.900
of change in that aspect, a certain point uh

335
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.609
uh at a certain uh threshold that's going to

336
00:22:28.619 --> 00:22:32.959
also have an effect upon other aspects. Uh So

337
00:22:32.969 --> 00:22:38.550
it's never just a simple um one item going

338
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.589
wrong. But it's rather, uh you, one has to

339
00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:45.780
look at the whole pattern to see uh what

340
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.729
has shifted and what has changed be because of

341
00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:52.359
a particular thing. It might be, uh, that, of

342
00:22:52.369 --> 00:22:55.780
course, you have to look in a particular uh

343
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.709
at a particular element in order to sort of

344
00:22:57.719 --> 00:23:01.400
see that as the primary issue that needs to

345
00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.319
be addressed. But there might be uh a number

346
00:23:04.329 --> 00:23:07.400
of different ways of addressing that uh in, in

347
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:08.920
the kind of clinical practice.

348
00:23:10.569 --> 00:23:15.060
Um What do you mean by self in your

349
00:23:15.069 --> 00:23:17.500
book? Be I'm asking you this because there are

350
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:22.430
different notions of self out there uh in philosophy

351
00:23:22.439 --> 00:23:27.540
of mind, for example, in neuroscience, psychology and elsewhere,

352
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.589
there are people that say for example, or claim

353
00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:34.719
that the self is just again a social construct.

354
00:23:34.729 --> 00:23:37.920
Other people say that it's the product of a

355
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:42.319
narrative of some sort. Others say that it is

356
00:23:42.329 --> 00:23:46.229
very minimal and it lasts for, I don't know

357
00:23:46.239 --> 00:23:50.410
a few seconds and then another self comes online

358
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.750
or something along those lines and other people even

359
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.000
link it to or try to link it to

360
00:23:56.010 --> 00:24:01.189
some neuronal processes. So uh what is your view

361
00:24:01.199 --> 00:24:01.599
of it?

362
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.459
Yeah. So the I guess the the core a

363
00:24:06.469 --> 00:24:09.079
claim in the book is uh is tied to

364
00:24:09.089 --> 00:24:11.800
this notion of self pattern. So what I would

365
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.880
say is the self just is a pattern, a

366
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.250
pattern of different elements. And I think that uh

367
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.229
the elements uh include uh a lot of different

368
00:24:22.239 --> 00:24:30.140
things, including embodied processes, um experiential processes, affected processes,

369
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.089
social processes and so forth and so on. Um

370
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.380
So, all of these factors uh and all of

371
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:41.089
these processes uh play a role in um in,

372
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:45.130
in uh um yeah, producing a, a kind of

373
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.609
pattern which I would say that's the self is

374
00:24:48.619 --> 00:24:52.550
a, it's not any one of those processes. Um

375
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.310
But it's the pattern that somehow or other um

376
00:24:56.319 --> 00:25:00.910
pulls these processes together in some way. Uh So

377
00:25:01.689 --> 00:25:05.130
that's uh my conception of the self just is,

378
00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.239
is that, that it is, in fact, uh a

379
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:13.329
self pattern. It's a pluralist conception. I, I think

380
00:25:13.339 --> 00:25:15.010
you can find the roots of it in people

381
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:20.229
like William James. Um um AND uh Ulrich Nicer.

382
00:25:20.239 --> 00:25:23.430
Um So I point to them as, as having

383
00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:25.630
pluralist conceptions of the South. And I think the

384
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.250
pattern theory in the South is a pluralist uh

385
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.020
conception which doesn't mean that there are many selves,

386
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.219
but there are many aspects that make up the

387
00:25:34.229 --> 00:25:35.709
pattern, which is the self.

388
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.209
And when it comes to these different aspects or

389
00:25:40.219 --> 00:25:44.010
different factors that play a role in generating the

390
00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.920
self, they relate to one another in a, in

391
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.849
a dynamical way.

392
00:25:50.089 --> 00:25:53.489
Correct. Yeah, that's uh that's what I, I would

393
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.300
want to say that. Um And, and there are,

394
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:59.829
have been some uh uh people who have said,

395
00:25:59.839 --> 00:26:02.030
look this, this looks just like a list of

396
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.869
things that you've and gathered together. Uh And uh

397
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.689
I want to say, well, yes. OK. It's a

398
00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:11.560
list of things but these, these processes are as

399
00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:16.119
processes, they are dynamically related to one another. So

400
00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:21.260
uh it's, you can't really pull apart uh social

401
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:25.920
aspects and the experiential or the affective or the

402
00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.430
embodied. These are all meshed in some way uh

403
00:26:30.579 --> 00:26:36.180
in, in a pattern that I typically characterize as

404
00:26:36.189 --> 00:26:39.699
a, a dynamical gestalt. So there's a, a pattern

405
00:26:39.709 --> 00:26:43.619
as a whole which uh is really constituted by

406
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.550
the various elements, processes, factors, whatever word you that

407
00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:53.030
seems appropriate. Uh And uh these uh the, the

408
00:26:53.040 --> 00:27:00.119
mesh of those factors uh really depend upon dynamical

409
00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.239
causal relations among them.

410
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.380
And how do you study or what is your

411
00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:10.709
proposal when it comes to how we could study

412
00:27:10.719 --> 00:27:13.770
the self pattern dynamics?

413
00:27:13.949 --> 00:27:15.979
Yeah. So I there's a chapter in the book

414
00:27:15.989 --> 00:27:21.250
where I uh I outline a particular threefold method

415
00:27:21.469 --> 00:27:26.079
um that uh would allow us to, to study.

416
00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.829
Um That's, that's definitely one answer to the, the

417
00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:34.719
kind of question you're asking. And there's another one

418
00:27:34.729 --> 00:27:37.780
that has to do with narrative. But uh in

419
00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:42.300
terms of the threefold uh approach, uh I think

420
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.390
of this more in terms of research than in

421
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.449
terms of the clinical. So if we think of

422
00:27:48.979 --> 00:27:53.280
uh a distinction between psychiatric research uh on the

423
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.459
one hand and uh psychiatric clinical practice on the

424
00:27:56.469 --> 00:28:00.719
other, I would say that this threefold approach is

425
00:28:00.729 --> 00:28:03.239
more on the research side. And the narrative approach

426
00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:07.660
is probably more on the clinical side. The threefold

427
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.800
approach involves really what I've done is I borrowed

428
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:17.109
quite, quite a bit from different disciplines. Um So

429
00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.280
I borrowed uh the notion of uh what is

430
00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:27.089
called the meshed architecture uh from uh performance studies

431
00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:31.430
where the question is, you know, how do we

432
00:28:31.439 --> 00:28:36.430
explain the relationship between say certain cognitive elements uh

433
00:28:36.439 --> 00:28:41.750
and a certain embodied elements in performance, performance that

434
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:47.400
might be um expert performance or skilled performance in

435
00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:52.589
the performing arts, for example. Um And uh there,

436
00:28:52.599 --> 00:28:56.319
I, I suggested that uh it's not just cognitive

437
00:28:56.329 --> 00:29:00.180
and it's not just bodily uh you know, motor

438
00:29:00.189 --> 00:29:05.989
control processes, but also social aspects, normative factors come

439
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.380
into play. And so you can build up a,

440
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:14.510
an architecture um um which tries to explain all

441
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.800
of the different elements that might be involved and

442
00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:22.869
how they might mesh together um to, to actually

443
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.530
test empirically um that kind of conception. Um I

444
00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:34.069
then appeal to James Woodward's uh notion of interventionist

445
00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:37.369
causality. Uh And the idea that you can intervene

446
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.719
on any one of those factors and then see

447
00:29:40.729 --> 00:29:44.609
how all of the other factors uh adjust or

448
00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:48.310
are affected by that intervention in order to test

449
00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:53.140
for the causal, I would say the dynamical relations

450
00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:58.130
between those factors. Um And uh and finally, I

451
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.359
borrow from Scott Kelso, uh his notion of coordinations

452
00:30:02.369 --> 00:30:07.010
dynamics, which really gets into the nitty gritty details

453
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:10.359
of the dynamics uh to try to show uh

454
00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:13.969
precisely how these things work and how they're related

455
00:30:13.979 --> 00:30:18.900
to one another. And what other effects specifically nonlinear

456
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.089
type effects that um a change might have on

457
00:30:22.099 --> 00:30:25.989
a variety of different factors. So if we think

458
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.050
of a self as a self pattern, which is

459
00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:33.439
composed of different processes and factors, one can use

460
00:30:33.449 --> 00:30:36.910
this kind of threefold approach in order to uh

461
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.329
at least study and try to understand the the

462
00:30:39.339 --> 00:30:43.729
possible variations within self patterns that some of which

463
00:30:43.739 --> 00:30:48.250
might in fact be pathological. Um So that would

464
00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.770
be uh it seems to me um well, an

465
00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.050
approach that would be useful in research. Mhm

466
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.239
uh But when it comes to how we would

467
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:05.099
approach each different kind of psychopathology or each different,

468
00:31:05.359 --> 00:31:10.359
let's say clinical case. Um I mean, uh would,

469
00:31:10.369 --> 00:31:14.439
is it the case that all of these different

470
00:31:14.449 --> 00:31:17.750
factors that you mentioned in the book that uh

471
00:31:17.829 --> 00:31:22.640
relate to one another dynamically would always play a

472
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.170
role in all of them? Or would we need

473
00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.989
to determine in each case which ones would be

474
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.880
relevant?

475
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:34.260
Uh I think the latter, I mean, I think

476
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:38.319
uh each case would be different. And uh the,

477
00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:41.160
I think the usefulness of the self pattern idea

478
00:31:41.439 --> 00:31:44.829
in the clinical setting is that it, it really

479
00:31:44.839 --> 00:31:50.949
gives the clinician um psychologist or psychiatrist uh something

480
00:31:50.959 --> 00:31:54.910
uh uh to use uh to, to be able

481
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.319
to sort of ask, you know, what, what exactly

482
00:31:57.329 --> 00:32:00.270
is going on with this patient. Uh And let's

483
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:04.989
look at the various aspects of the self pattern

484
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.810
and see if we can uh give a, a

485
00:32:09.819 --> 00:32:14.770
description of uh this particular person's uh problems uh

486
00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.010
in, in those terms. And then once, if we

487
00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.089
can, if we can do that, it might be

488
00:32:21.099 --> 00:32:25.170
that uh some, some of those features are simply

489
00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:29.949
uh they, they look like the the primary problem.

490
00:32:29.959 --> 00:32:32.569
And, and then we can try to address those,

491
00:32:32.579 --> 00:32:36.510
those features knowing of course, that by addressing one

492
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.609
feature, one process in the self pattern, it's going

493
00:32:39.619 --> 00:32:41.260
to have an effect on the, on the rest

494
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.630
as well. So we look there as well. So

495
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.869
it's uh I think it's uh maybe a useful

496
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.780
tool. I hope it's a useful tool for um

497
00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:55.790
clinicians to, to use that, that, that wouldn't necessarily

498
00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:02.209
entail that whole kind of a threefold uh methodology

499
00:33:02.219 --> 00:33:04.609
that I I outlined uh that that would be

500
00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:07.969
again more for research on the clinical side. They

501
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:12.489
uh it's it's very uh useful to uh to

502
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.449
think about this in terms of the narrative and

503
00:33:15.459 --> 00:33:21.239
how um narrative is one element of the self

504
00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:26.729
pattern. So uh that's, that's something that uh one

505
00:33:26.739 --> 00:33:29.329
can look at, but it, it's also the case

506
00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:33.109
that narrative uh I claim narrative reflects all of

507
00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:36.989
the other aspects of the self pattern. Uh So

508
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.729
that one can use kind of uh as a

509
00:33:40.739 --> 00:33:43.530
as a kind of tool uh narrative as a

510
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:48.439
way into seeing exactly how things are, are arranged

511
00:33:48.449 --> 00:33:51.030
or disarranged within the salt powder.

512
00:33:52.349 --> 00:33:55.209
Another concept I would like to ask you about

513
00:33:55.219 --> 00:34:00.020
is the concept of self narrative. So what is

514
00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.569
it? And according to the framework you present in

515
00:34:03.579 --> 00:34:09.080
your book, how would it relate to pathological experiences?

516
00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.330
Yeah. So as I, as I, as I said,

517
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:18.668
it's um it, I take the, the narrative aspect

518
00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:22.958
of the uh self pattern to be one element.

519
00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:26.520
It's, it's very closely related to uh our ability

520
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:30.208
to reflect on our life. So, reflection and narrative

521
00:34:30.219 --> 00:34:34.879
kind of go hand in hand. And um self

522
00:34:34.899 --> 00:34:37.820
narrative is uh simply the ability of the, the

523
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.688
person to say um you know, what uh what

524
00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:43.879
their life is like, uh what it has been

525
00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:49.478
like, how they relate to other people, um what

526
00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:53.870
they're doing with respect to their work environment. Um

527
00:34:54.228 --> 00:34:57.280
All, all kinds of different things come into our

528
00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:01.520
self narratives. Um And, and so what we're finding

529
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.439
in that self narrative is something a reflect uh

530
00:35:04.449 --> 00:35:09.020
of a reflection of how the person is experiencing

531
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:14.030
um life, uh what they're, you know, whether they're

532
00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.989
having any kind of physical uh problems, you know,

533
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.810
so that would be the embodiment factor, what their,

534
00:35:21.189 --> 00:35:24.780
what their feelings or emotions are like. Uh That

535
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:28.610
would be an effective uh issue, uh how they

536
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:34.459
relate to other people. Um HOW they, the, you

537
00:35:34.469 --> 00:35:37.070
know what they think about their living conditions, their

538
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.469
work conditions. So the environment kind of comes into

539
00:35:40.479 --> 00:35:44.969
this normative factors about how they're supposed to be

540
00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:49.129
behaving within certain environments. Um So there's a lot

541
00:35:49.139 --> 00:35:52.610
there to explore. So one can explore through the

542
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.360
self narrative, all of these other factors. And then

543
00:35:56.689 --> 00:36:02.239
uh one can, one can then uh see in

544
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:08.070
what sense there is some problem, uh some suffering

545
00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.370
that needs to be addressed. Uh And uh in

546
00:36:11.379 --> 00:36:15.239
that respect, then define something uh like a uh

547
00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:21.379
a pathological case. The there is a lot of

548
00:36:21.389 --> 00:36:28.870
research uh on self narratives in various conditions. Uh

549
00:36:28.879 --> 00:36:34.000
uh So, uh people have as, as I put

550
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:36.070
it in the uh in the book, uh the

551
00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.379
self narrative can be almost like a fingerprint, a

552
00:36:38.389 --> 00:36:45.080
test of uh whether the content and or the

553
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.919
structure of the narrative gives us uh any kind

554
00:36:48.929 --> 00:36:52.209
of sign of whether or not we're, we're dealing

555
00:36:52.219 --> 00:36:57.290
with a case of schizophrenia versus depression uh or

556
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:02.070
uh or any other kind of um uh condition.

557
00:37:02.949 --> 00:37:05.550
Uh So, a and, but that again goes on

558
00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.840
to the research side and it's uh that kind

559
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:13.909
of analysis of is on one hand, it can

560
00:37:13.919 --> 00:37:16.909
be se semantic uh in terms of the content

561
00:37:16.919 --> 00:37:19.530
of what the person is saying. We also uh

562
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:23.389
can look at the form uh the syntactical structure

563
00:37:23.399 --> 00:37:27.379
of the narrative that may uh be typical for

564
00:37:27.389 --> 00:37:31.379
a particular condition that's not necessarily something that can

565
00:37:31.389 --> 00:37:34.629
be looked at uh by the clinician in a,

566
00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:37.560
in an easy way. But again, for research that

567
00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.010
could, that could serve us. Uh Yeah. So narrative

568
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.350
uh I think it seems to me uh self

569
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:48.649
narrative plays uh an interesting role here uh that

570
00:37:48.659 --> 00:37:52.219
uh opens up the possibility of analysis uh for

571
00:37:52.229 --> 00:37:55.540
uh for this particular co uh patient.

572
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.870
Uh But just to illustrate what we're talking about

573
00:38:00.879 --> 00:38:04.879
here with a particular example of a condition. Uh

574
00:38:04.889 --> 00:38:09.879
HOW does self narrative play out or how does

575
00:38:09.889 --> 00:38:14.489
it uh it's disintegration, let's say, play out in

576
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.709
the case of schizophrenia, for example.

577
00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:22.340
Yeah. Well, as I say, there are some researchers

578
00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:26.699
who have looked specifically at narratives uh um uh

579
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:31.389
uh generated by uh people who are experiencing uh

580
00:38:31.399 --> 00:38:34.790
schizophrenia. And so what are they looking at? They,

581
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.530
they may be looking uh uh I get at

582
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.489
some of those syntactical features but they uh that's

583
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:45.520
some more technical type of uh investigation. But there

584
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:50.340
might be other things that um show something like

585
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:54.360
uh a uh a reduced uh reference to uh

586
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:59.790
the first person pronoun um a reduced uh uh

587
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:04.639
you know, reference to self problems with self agency.

588
00:39:04.649 --> 00:39:09.110
Um And uh maybe problems with dissociation from their

589
00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:13.580
body. Um So, there are all kinds of cues

590
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:17.129
here. Uh And, and whether, you know, to what

591
00:39:17.139 --> 00:39:21.290
extent they fit with a, a diagnosis of schizophrenia

592
00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.810
as opposed to borderline personality disorder, that, that, of

593
00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:30.219
course, is not easy. But that's, that's why the

594
00:39:30.229 --> 00:39:34.350
psychiatrist uh uh is, is required. And uh they,

595
00:39:34.439 --> 00:39:38.159
they have training and expertise uh in this. Uh

596
00:39:38.169 --> 00:39:40.790
So anyway, it seems to me that the, it's

597
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.429
the self narrative that can tell us something about

598
00:39:43.439 --> 00:39:48.419
just those uh those features that might be uh

599
00:39:48.429 --> 00:39:53.649
considered symptoms or uh clues to what precisely is

600
00:39:53.659 --> 00:39:55.620
going on with that the patient.

601
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.879
So at a certain point there, you use the

602
00:39:59.889 --> 00:40:03.899
term agency. And in the book, you talk about

603
00:40:03.909 --> 00:40:09.060
the experiences of agency and ownership as elements in

604
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:13.040
the phenomenology of the self pattern. So, um

605
00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:13.709
what

606
00:40:13.719 --> 00:40:14.409
role

607
00:40:14.419 --> 00:40:15.179
do

608
00:40:15.219 --> 00:40:17.379
they play here exactly?

609
00:40:18.919 --> 00:40:23.750
OK. Well, the the notion of a sense of

610
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.350
agency or a sense of ownership uh originally, uh

611
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:33.030
the idea was that these are experiential uh aspects.

612
00:40:33.889 --> 00:40:36.929
So they belong to that experiential part of the

613
00:40:36.939 --> 00:40:41.199
self pattern. Um But I think it's much more

614
00:40:41.209 --> 00:40:46.510
complex than that since uh and this, this again,

615
00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.439
sort of is uh supportive of the idea that

616
00:40:49.449 --> 00:40:52.939
the self pattern uh is not just, you know,

617
00:40:52.949 --> 00:40:56.429
a collection of individual factors, but in fact, is,

618
00:40:56.889 --> 00:41:00.550
you know, uh consists of dynamical relations among these

619
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.689
factors. So if, if something like um a as

620
00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:11.189
you find in schizophrenic delusions, for example, something like

621
00:41:11.389 --> 00:41:14.550
um a problem with the sense of agency develops

622
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.540
at that kind of basic experiential level. So this

623
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.439
is uh a kind of anomalous experience that the

624
00:41:22.449 --> 00:41:27.370
schizophrenic might be having. Um THAT it doesn't stop

625
00:41:27.379 --> 00:41:30.639
there because um that can enter into the narrative

626
00:41:30.649 --> 00:41:34.709
um that can enter into the reflective uh uh

627
00:41:34.719 --> 00:41:38.820
uh processes that the, the patient might uh start

628
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.459
to employ thinking about what, you know, what is

629
00:41:42.469 --> 00:41:46.560
exactly going on with uh with this experience. So

630
00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.550
how can I explain it uh that can sort

631
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:54.290
of then feed into a more delusional um uh

632
00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:59.600
experience and uh the, you know, the sense of

633
00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:02.260
agency. If you, if you look closely at it,

634
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:07.110
it, it also involves social relations. Uh YOU know,

635
00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:11.310
it's, it's often tied to distinctions between self and

636
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.050
other. Am I the one acting or is the

637
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.219
other person doing this? Uh And so it, there's

638
00:42:18.229 --> 00:42:22.659
a social dimension, intersubject of uh uh relations are

639
00:42:22.669 --> 00:42:25.760
sort of at stake sometimes in this. So then

640
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:31.330
we find again and something like schizophrenic uh schizophrenia

641
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:36.939
that yeah, social factors also are disrupted. Uh So

642
00:42:36.949 --> 00:42:40.379
it's not just experiential, it's not just, you know

643
00:42:40.389 --> 00:42:44.389
what the phenomenological psychologists would say that it's just

644
00:42:44.399 --> 00:42:48.790
uh a minimal self or minimal self experience, but

645
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.919
in fact, it involves other people. It involves our

646
00:42:52.929 --> 00:42:56.125
experience of the world. Uh It can involve our,

647
00:42:56.135 --> 00:42:59.344
our body and uh and so forth and so

648
00:42:59.354 --> 00:43:02.264
on. So it then becomes this even this. If

649
00:43:02.274 --> 00:43:04.675
you trace out the sense of agency, it becomes

650
00:43:04.685 --> 00:43:08.655
a very complex thing spread over all of the

651
00:43:08.665 --> 00:43:12.004
other factors of, of the self uh pattern.

652
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.959
And another concept that is important here is autonomy.

653
00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:21.129
So where is autonomy? And uh why does it

654
00:43:21.139 --> 00:43:24.159
matter in the context of mental disorder?

655
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.120
Yeah. Uh I think there is a several different

656
00:43:29.129 --> 00:43:33.820
ways to think about autonomy in this context. Uh

657
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:37.780
First of all, I, I've uh I'm very much

658
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:41.270
influenced here when I think of autonomy, I'm influenced

659
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.959
by some feminist thought uh that um you know,

660
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:50.580
specifies that autonomy is not just this kind of

661
00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:57.389
individual characteristic of uh a single person. Uh But

662
00:43:57.399 --> 00:44:01.040
rather it has to do with our social relations,

663
00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:06.620
our intersubject relations, especially. So it's a relational notion

664
00:44:06.629 --> 00:44:09.520
of autonomy that I'm I'm dealing with in the

665
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:12.270
book. Uh So I, but I take that uh

666
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.040
from uh well, we find that in critical phenomenology

667
00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:22.639
and feminist thinkers. Uh So assuming, assuming that, assuming

668
00:44:22.649 --> 00:44:29.489
that autonomy is, in fact um uh relational uh

669
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.280
then of course, things can go wrong um with

670
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:38.770
our social relations. Um And uh things can go

671
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.699
wrong with all the other aspects of the self

672
00:44:41.709 --> 00:44:45.290
pattern as well that can interfere uh with our

673
00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.610
autonomy. One way, another way to think about it

674
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:54.030
is in terms of uh affordances. Um And I

675
00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.030
do a little bit of uh this type of

676
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.530
analysis in the book where the idea is that

677
00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:07.780
pathological uh conditions may in fact uh um uh

678
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:11.840
lead to a disruption of uh uh our normal

679
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:16.090
affordances in life that we might feel that we

680
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.500
cannot engage with others or we cannot engage with

681
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:23.260
the world. Uh Or we feel anxious about all

682
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:26.540
of those things. So if the, the, you might

683
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:31.320
say the, the uh the level of affordances that

684
00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:36.760
are available to us uh are diminished. Uh And

685
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:41.020
I think that suggests that uh in, in fact,

686
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:45.179
we lose some autonomy, that our autonomy diminishes as

687
00:45:45.189 --> 00:45:48.540
well. Uh And if you think that autonomy is

688
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:52.409
important, which uh most theorists do, then uh the

689
00:45:52.419 --> 00:45:56.929
diminishment of autonomy. However, we understand that uh it

690
00:45:56.939 --> 00:45:59.790
could be very much a part of something like

691
00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.889
a psychopathology.

692
00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:05.229
So I would like to ask you now about

693
00:46:05.239 --> 00:46:09.550
some the uh therapeutic approaches and particular kinds of

694
00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:14.550
technologies that some people propose or are already used

695
00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:18.590
to address uh psychopathology or try to try to

696
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.540
treat it. So, what do you make of uh

697
00:46:23.229 --> 00:46:26.419
is uh claims that people make about how we

698
00:46:26.429 --> 00:46:33.540
could address psychopathology targeting directly the brain itself? For

699
00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:37.139
ex for example, sometimes people uh talk about uh

700
00:46:37.149 --> 00:46:42.114
doing some human announcement through applications that would target

701
00:46:42.125 --> 00:46:45.985
the brain. Since your approach here in the book

702
00:46:45.995 --> 00:46:50.665
is about the self pattern as distributed across brain

703
00:46:50.675 --> 00:46:53.975
body and environment. What do you make of those

704
00:46:53.985 --> 00:46:56.064
kinds of proposals?

705
00:46:57.570 --> 00:47:01.360
Right. I think. So, the um I would say

706
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:06.280
that one can intervene uh on um the self

707
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:09.810
pattern in a variety of ways in one way

708
00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.969
could be by an intervention on the brain. Um

709
00:47:12.979 --> 00:47:18.729
UNDERSTANDING that if through medication or deep brain stimulation.

710
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:23.290
We affect a change in the dynamics of uh

711
00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.620
the brain that's going to have an effect on

712
00:47:26.629 --> 00:47:30.679
the body and our experience of the environment. And

713
00:47:30.689 --> 00:47:33.270
that's that therefore is going to have an effect

714
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:37.360
on these other aspects of the self pattern. So

715
00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:40.270
again, I would just say we, we need to

716
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:45.469
take a wide perspective on uh just these kinds

717
00:47:45.479 --> 00:47:48.310
of therapies. I mean, there there are many different

718
00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:52.449
therapies, we can intervene, let's say on a self

719
00:47:52.459 --> 00:47:55.790
pattern in a variety of different ways. One way

720
00:47:55.800 --> 00:48:00.060
could be to intervene um in terms of medication,

721
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:05.159
uh changing brain chemistry uh or changing the dynamics

722
00:48:05.169 --> 00:48:08.500
in the brain with uh deep brain stimulation or

723
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.370
something like that. Um But all of that is

724
00:48:11.379 --> 00:48:13.540
a kind of intervention that still has an effect

725
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:18.250
upon the rest of the self pattern. Uh So

726
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:21.040
it, it, it might work the best in some

727
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:23.459
cases and in other cases, it might not work

728
00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:25.949
at all. And we don't have a really good

729
00:48:25.959 --> 00:48:30.110
understanding of, of how medication, for example works. Uh

730
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.870
You know, we, we know sometimes it works and

731
00:48:32.879 --> 00:48:36.040
sometimes it doesn't, why is that? We're not quite

732
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:41.820
sure. Uh So, um it's, it's not necessarily always

733
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:45.159
the best solution. Uh And uh we have to

734
00:48:45.169 --> 00:48:45.879
be aware of that

735
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:50.510
on the topic of technology. Something that I found

736
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.750
really interesting in your book is that at a

737
00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:56.330
certain point you talk about A E I. So

738
00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:59.909
I, in what ways do you relate A I

739
00:48:59.919 --> 00:49:03.379
or the use of A I to the kinds

740
00:49:03.389 --> 00:49:06.280
of topics you explore in the book, particularly when

741
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:10.729
it comes to how it might change the self

742
00:49:10.739 --> 00:49:11.550
pattern.

743
00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:16.360
Yeah. So there, uh you know, I have a

744
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:21.729
chapter on this. Uh ALSO there are artificial intelligence,

745
00:49:21.739 --> 00:49:27.729
um enhanced therapies, uh let's say, uh or um

746
00:49:27.739 --> 00:49:32.129
the use of artificial intelligence and some therapeutic tools.

747
00:49:33.239 --> 00:49:36.530
And uh you, you can think of, there's a,

748
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.500
an old uh uh idea of the chat box

749
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.320
of Eliza that, you know, goes back, I think

750
00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:48.100
to the seventies or something. Um They, uh and

751
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.979
in fact, you know, if you, it's a very

752
00:49:50.989 --> 00:49:56.649
simple, a very simple program where you uh Eliza

753
00:49:56.659 --> 00:49:59.679
is a program that simply kind of repeats what

754
00:49:59.689 --> 00:50:03.080
you say. If you say, you know, I'm having

755
00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:06.600
trouble sleeping. Eliza will say, well, tell me about

756
00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:10.179
your trouble sleeping and it's not like they, there's

757
00:50:10.189 --> 00:50:13.209
anything there except a kind of mirroring of what

758
00:50:13.219 --> 00:50:15.760
you're saying, but it turns out that it turn

759
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:21.030
that some patients find this actually therapeutic, that they're

760
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.090
at least getting to talk about their problems. Uh

761
00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:28.090
And, and that might itself be uh what's going

762
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:33.370
on there. And now more recently, um these chat

763
00:50:33.379 --> 00:50:37.649
boxes have become pretty sophisticated uh using, you know,

764
00:50:37.659 --> 00:50:44.469
recent uh uh developments in artificial intelligence. So, is

765
00:50:44.479 --> 00:50:47.469
this something uh you know, people are asking, you

766
00:50:47.479 --> 00:50:50.159
know, is this something we, we can use uh

767
00:50:50.169 --> 00:50:54.679
um uh more uh pervasively in terms of treatment.

768
00:50:55.419 --> 00:50:58.459
Uh And uh again, I would say it could

769
00:50:58.469 --> 00:51:00.760
be an intervention that might be very helpful in

770
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:03.570
some cases and maybe it doesn't work at all

771
00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:07.510
in other cases. So there is this, you know,

772
00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.139
I, I discussed this problem in Borderline Personality Disorder

773
00:51:11.149 --> 00:51:17.270
um that uh that some, uh some people uh

774
00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:21.939
with uh this condition might find it difficult to

775
00:51:21.949 --> 00:51:26.750
relate to the, the therapist in a face to

776
00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:30.229
face kind of relationship, but might not find it

777
00:51:30.239 --> 00:51:32.709
difficult at all to relate to a chat box.

778
00:51:32.719 --> 00:51:35.860
And so for, for that person, uh if it's

779
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:37.820
an issue having to do with trust or, or

780
00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:41.239
whatever, it might be that the chat box could,

781
00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:45.570
could actually function pretty well. And if it's enhanced

782
00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:49.520
by artificial intelligence, then that might be even even

783
00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:53.879
better. So again, it's uh it's another kind of

784
00:51:53.889 --> 00:51:57.879
uh therapeutic therapeutic approach that that could have um

785
00:51:57.889 --> 00:52:01.550
good applications. Um BUT not necessarily the right one

786
00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.879
for every condition.

787
00:52:04.389 --> 00:52:08.030
So another sort of uh therapeutic approach that you

788
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.429
talk about in the book, I is the one

789
00:52:11.439 --> 00:52:16.469
that is based on mindfulness and other related uh

790
00:52:16.479 --> 00:52:21.000
meditative approaches, let's say so. But before we get

791
00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:26.139
into the psychiatry of it, let's say, uh i

792
00:52:26.169 --> 00:52:28.909
it's interesting because in the book, you talk about

793
00:52:28.919 --> 00:52:34.489
the self self pattern uh since mindfulness is originally

794
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:39.260
based on Buddhism, uh what do you make of

795
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:42.510
the kinds of approaches that the Buddhists tend to

796
00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:45.489
have to the self. And do, do you think

797
00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:49.050
that it, there could be any sort of conflict

798
00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:53.600
between that and uh the framework you present in

799
00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:55.000
the book or not?

800
00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.500
Uh OK. Yeah. Thanks for that question. It's uh

801
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.610
it's good. First of all, I, I guess I

802
00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:08.739
would say that there's no one unified uh view

803
00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:11.429
of the self in Buddhism. Uh The, you know,

804
00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:16.419
Buddhism is a very old tradition with huge number

805
00:53:16.429 --> 00:53:20.979
of debates uh ongoing uh and traditional debates as

806
00:53:20.989 --> 00:53:23.370
well as ongoing debates about what the, what, what

807
00:53:23.379 --> 00:53:25.649
we mean by the self and, and how we

808
00:53:25.659 --> 00:53:28.320
can think of it and the idea of there

809
00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:34.290
being no self uh as well. Um So, yeah,

810
00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.229
so it's uh it's difficult to speak just of

811
00:53:37.239 --> 00:53:40.949
the Buddhist conception of the self. Um But uh

812
00:53:40.959 --> 00:53:44.479
having said that there are definitely certain arguments uh

813
00:53:44.489 --> 00:53:50.570
within the contemplative community uh that uh you know,

814
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:55.379
borrow, borrow heavily from uh uh borrows heavily from

815
00:53:55.389 --> 00:54:01.699
Buddhism um about, you know, at attaining AAA non

816
00:54:01.709 --> 00:54:06.129
dual state through meditation practice, uh a state where

817
00:54:06.139 --> 00:54:09.370
the self is very much diminished and perhaps at

818
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.020
the end disappears if, if you become expert at

819
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.699
it. Um Now, the, the question there is uh

820
00:54:16.709 --> 00:54:21.260
what exactly is meant by the self. Uh And

821
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.520
uh you know, how does it relate to the

822
00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:26.459
notion of the self pattern? Uh So I, I

823
00:54:26.469 --> 00:54:30.290
have actually worked on this. Um II I talk

824
00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.620
about a little bit within the uh within the

825
00:54:33.629 --> 00:54:36.229
book, but there are several other papers that I've

826
00:54:36.239 --> 00:54:40.340
been co-authored on uh uh with uh a large

827
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:44.959
group of, of um people in uh who, who

828
00:54:44.969 --> 00:54:48.540
know Buddhism better than I do. Uh So Buddhist

829
00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:53.629
scholars uh also neuroscientists, psychologists in this group. And

830
00:54:53.639 --> 00:54:57.969
we have, we have talked about um the idea

831
00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:01.510
that uh yeah, there is a kind of consistency

832
00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.590
between certain Buddhist doctrines and the notion of the

833
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:08.399
self pattern. The idea that the, that what we

834
00:55:08.409 --> 00:55:12.280
call the self is made up of different attributes

835
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:16.979
um uh different processes. Uh AND that no one

836
00:55:16.989 --> 00:55:22.080
process uh is equivalent to the self. So th

837
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:26.350
this again, kind of leaves it open to the

838
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.820
idea that the self is something like a pattern.

839
00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:32.270
There's no one element that is equivalent to the

840
00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.330
self. And this, the, the pattern itself is uh

841
00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:42.000
what is important uh in within the pattern. There

842
00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:46.570
are certain elements of the pattern that if they

843
00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:51.850
are emphasized or focused upon, they might lead to

844
00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:55.149
a kind of rigidity, uh rigidity within the self

845
00:55:55.159 --> 00:56:00.270
pattern. And this could become pathological. So I think

846
00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.600
one of the, one of the really important things

847
00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:08.120
that uh the, the Buddhist or the meditation tradition

848
00:56:08.129 --> 00:56:11.760
gives us is this idea that we can address

849
00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:17.739
um the rigidity problem that we can through a

850
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.489
kind of meditation practices, uh introduce some more flexibility,

851
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.699
more flex flexibility into the self pattern. And this

852
00:56:25.709 --> 00:56:29.830
could in fact be therapeutic uh to relieve a

853
00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:33.639
kind of pathological rigidity that might might be uh

854
00:56:33.679 --> 00:56:37.110
at issue. And if, if that's the case, then

855
00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.260
uh meditation could be a useful uh therapeutic uh

856
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:42.209
approach.

857
00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:47.219
Uh But uh currently, what do we know about

858
00:56:47.229 --> 00:56:51.760
the therapeutic effects of mindfulness? I mean, are they

859
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:56.350
always positive or is it that sometimes it might

860
00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:59.469
have potential adverse effects?

861
00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:03.320
Yes, there is a, a literature, a growing literature,

862
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:07.090
I think on the possibility that mindfulness could have

863
00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:11.489
potential adverse effects, as you say so, and then,

864
00:57:12.189 --> 00:57:14.739
uh but then I think that could probably be

865
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:17.370
said about any therapy that it could take you,

866
00:57:17.379 --> 00:57:19.340
you know, a little bit too far in some

867
00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:24.739
direction. Um So, uh I think that just, that

868
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:27.530
just says, uh we have to be careful about

869
00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:33.219
that. And again, this is why it's important. I

870
00:57:33.229 --> 00:57:35.919
mean, the, the Buddhist tradition always says it's important

871
00:57:35.929 --> 00:57:38.219
to have a teacher. Uh I think in this

872
00:57:38.229 --> 00:57:42.020
context, it's important to have a trained psychiatrist involved

873
00:57:42.399 --> 00:57:44.649
uh and not just practice this on your own.

874
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:49.229
Um And uh it's, it's then, you know, the

875
00:57:49.239 --> 00:57:52.189
skill of the psychiatrist and the art of the

876
00:57:52.199 --> 00:57:56.739
practice that will be able to uh help us

877
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:59.429
determine whether or not this is going too far,

878
00:57:59.459 --> 00:58:03.830
whether it's being beneficial, whether we're getting flexibility, whether

879
00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.399
we're cutting down on rigidity and so forth. So

880
00:58:06.409 --> 00:58:09.209
that's, that's part of the practice. Yes.

881
00:58:10.219 --> 00:58:13.949
So one last topic that is also the last

882
00:58:13.959 --> 00:58:16.330
one you explore in your, in your book that

883
00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.159
I would like to ask you about has to

884
00:58:18.169 --> 00:58:23.439
do with things like torture, solitary confinement, uh and

885
00:58:23.449 --> 00:58:27.669
cruelty. So, uh first of all, why did you

886
00:58:27.679 --> 00:58:32.100
include a chapter on those topics in your book?

887
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:36.239
In what ways do they relate to the exploration

888
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:39.500
you make of things like the self and the

889
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:42.699
self pattern uh in the book?

890
00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:48.969
OK. Um Yeah, I mean, they relate in, in

891
00:58:48.979 --> 00:58:53.520
terms of uh uh causes of trauma and uh

892
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:57.429
of course, trauma is something that can lead uh

893
00:58:57.439 --> 00:59:04.530
to psychopathological experience and conditions. Um So tor uh

894
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.570
you know, to bodily torture uh isn't just bodily,

895
00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:12.699
it's psychological, it's uh it, I would say, you

896
00:59:12.709 --> 00:59:14.489
know, it will have an effect on all those

897
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:18.280
different elements of the self pattern. And uh in

898
00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:21.649
a similar fashion, uh solitary confinement has been shown,

899
00:59:21.659 --> 00:59:25.010
I mean, there's been empirical work to show the

900
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:28.399
damage that it can cause to the individual. And

901
00:59:28.409 --> 00:59:31.050
it turns out that if you sort of look

902
00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:34.719
at all of the different aspects that uh are,

903
00:59:34.729 --> 00:59:39.120
are damaged, uh you can go right through the

904
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:43.060
um all of the elements of, you know, what

905
00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:45.159
I consider to be the self pattern and see

906
00:59:45.169 --> 00:59:46.909
that it has an effect on all of them,

907
00:59:46.919 --> 00:59:50.629
you know, embodiment one's effective life one's and of

908
00:59:50.639 --> 00:59:53.100
course what it is, it's a, it's a taking

909
00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:57.790
away the intersubject social aspect, you know, it's saying,

910
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.060
right, solitary confinement, we, you're not going to be

911
01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:04.860
able to interact with anybody. And that, that, that

912
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:07.659
gives you a clear idea of what, what the

913
01:00:07.669 --> 01:00:11.469
main problem is, but it turns out that take

914
01:00:11.479 --> 01:00:15.199
away social relations and in some cases that really

915
01:00:15.209 --> 01:00:17.899
has a profound effect on all of the other

916
01:00:17.909 --> 01:00:22.459
factors and people break down in a completely uh

917
01:00:22.939 --> 01:00:27.580
a completely uh uh serious way uh in terms

918
01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:31.719
of their, their life, um they can, they can

919
01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:35.290
recover from this. Uh But uh nonetheless, uh it's

920
01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.479
a huge amount of suffering. So there's been uh

921
01:00:38.489 --> 01:00:42.550
debates about this, of course, in the legal profession

922
01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.219
as well, but a lot of it really is

923
01:00:46.229 --> 01:00:52.419
uh uh tuned to the psychological effects uh and

924
01:00:52.429 --> 01:00:55.889
the effects on the, the person more generally. Mhm

925
01:00:56.780 --> 01:01:02.360
uh But how do you approach drama within the

926
01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:06.459
framework you adopt in the book? What does drama

927
01:01:06.469 --> 01:01:08.360
mean? Exactly?

928
01:01:10.649 --> 01:01:13.389
Well, I think uh i it seems to me

929
01:01:13.399 --> 01:01:16.949
that trauma is sort of at the extreme of

930
01:01:16.959 --> 01:01:22.649
uh of conditions that uh it like a tr

931
01:01:22.689 --> 01:01:27.469
a traumatic incident will intervene at some on some

932
01:01:27.479 --> 01:01:31.600
part of the self pattern and then cause of

933
01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:34.709
a very serious disruption. And it could be a

934
01:01:34.719 --> 01:01:39.179
very explicit type of disruption where it's quite apparent.

935
01:01:39.189 --> 01:01:42.429
And that that happens, for example, in solitary confinement,

936
01:01:42.439 --> 01:01:45.229
uh in many cases that it's really a complete

937
01:01:45.239 --> 01:01:48.669
breakdown. I uh immediate, not immediately but, you know,

938
01:01:48.679 --> 01:01:54.239
over a short course of time, um, uh, or

939
01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:57.060
torture could have certainly, uh, worked that way as

940
01:01:57.070 --> 01:02:01.080
well. Um, BUT also there are long term effects.

941
01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:03.959
Um, AND it might be more subtle, it might

942
01:02:03.969 --> 01:02:08.399
be more implicit uh, trauma, uh, has a, a

943
01:02:08.409 --> 01:02:12.110
long life, let's say. Uh And uh that kind

944
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:16.030
of problem that someone might, might develop within the,

945
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.919
the organization of their self pattern, might be hidden

946
01:02:19.929 --> 01:02:22.310
away for a while and only come out at

947
01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.810
certain points and under certain conditions. So there are

948
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:29.209
different ways uh we could think of trauma and

949
01:02:29.219 --> 01:02:31.510
how it has an effect upon the self pattern.

950
01:02:31.929 --> 01:02:34.919
Um But uh it's, I think it's a really

951
01:02:34.929 --> 01:02:37.300
an important topic to, to take a look at.

952
01:02:38.489 --> 01:02:42.800
So my last question and related to the two

953
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:47.540
issues surrounding torture and solitary confinement, for example, uh

954
01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:52.229
what is uh cruelty? Because uh usually when it,

955
01:02:52.239 --> 01:02:56.189
we talk about cruelty, we put it in uh

956
01:02:56.199 --> 01:03:02.889
moral terms. But in this context of psychiatry and

957
01:03:02.899 --> 01:03:07.459
uh psychiatric approaches to the mind, uh how would

958
01:03:07.469 --> 01:03:10.479
you talk about cruelty?

959
01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.850
Mm. That's a great question. I mean, in, in

960
01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.729
the book, I really, um think about it in

961
01:03:17.739 --> 01:03:22.219
terms of the legal definition. Mhm. Uh So in

962
01:03:22.229 --> 01:03:25.530
the US anyway, it's uh uh there's this phrase

963
01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:30.020
about cruel and unusual punishment and the question is,

964
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:32.399
uh of course, torture would be something like cruel

965
01:03:32.409 --> 01:03:37.199
and unusual punishment. Question about solitary confinement. Some people

966
01:03:37.209 --> 01:03:40.129
say it is. Some people argue it's not uh

967
01:03:40.139 --> 01:03:42.129
but part of the argument has to do with

968
01:03:42.139 --> 01:03:44.550
the notion of cruelty. Exactly. How do you define

969
01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.689
cruelty? And uh then you, you find in the

970
01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:53.129
legal uh uh literature that there is no uh

971
01:03:53.139 --> 01:03:56.800
there's no consensus there about what we call uh

972
01:03:56.820 --> 01:04:02.469
cruel punishment. So I think uh that's, that's a

973
01:04:02.479 --> 01:04:05.820
question that uh in the legal profession is open.

974
01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:08.389
But if you look at the empirical data, if

975
01:04:08.399 --> 01:04:11.800
you look at the empirical uh studies of something

976
01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:15.560
like solitary confinement, and if you, if you can

977
01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:21.379
say yes, well, in solitary confinement, the whole, the

978
01:04:21.389 --> 01:04:25.439
self pattern starts to discrim uh to uh uh

979
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:30.330
yeah, to be totally disrupted. Um AND leading to

980
01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:33.489
all kinds of problems and I would say, leading

981
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.929
to all kinds of suffering for that individual. Um

982
01:04:37.939 --> 01:04:42.320
If the suffering is of such a high degree,

983
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:44.689
then I, I can say, then we could say

984
01:04:44.699 --> 01:04:48.050
that, well, that's cruel. That would be a, a

985
01:04:48.169 --> 01:04:52.040
way to characterize. I think it's better to say,

986
01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:56.649
characterized than define. Um But a way to characterize

987
01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:59.989
uh cruelty, trying to get a good definition of

988
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.810
it is going to be difficult just because we're

989
01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:07.629
talking about different disciplines. Uh AND uh and debates

990
01:05:07.639 --> 01:05:11.060
within each of those disciplines. Uh But to characterize

991
01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:12.770
it, I think, uh you know, you know, it,

992
01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.330
when you see it, if, if there's a complete

993
01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.850
breakdown and a huge amount of suffering on the

994
01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.419
part of the person. Then that has to be

995
01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.449
uh a way to talk about the cruelty involved.

996
01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:29.239
So the book is again the self and its

997
01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:32.000
disorders. I'm leaving a link to it in the

998
01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:35.580
description of the interview and Doctor Gallagher. Uh Just

999
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:38.260
before we go apart from the book, would you

1000
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:41.250
like to tell people where they can find you

1001
01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.360
or your work on the internet?

1002
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.899
Oh, sure. They can uh Google Google me or,

1003
01:05:47.909 --> 01:05:50.500
you know, look me up on the internet. Uh

1004
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:54.300
I have a website um um so they could,

1005
01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:56.979
they won't be able to find that. Uh I

1006
01:05:56.989 --> 01:06:00.909
have an academia website also if they're interested in

1007
01:06:01.219 --> 01:06:06.320
publications and research gate uh website as well. So,

1008
01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.699
uh there's, there's a number of places where you

1009
01:06:08.709 --> 01:06:12.679
can find uh my work and uh my publications

1010
01:06:12.689 --> 01:06:15.100
and uh I think a good number of them

1011
01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:18.659
are available uh free. So it's uh you don't

1012
01:06:18.669 --> 01:06:22.939
have to uh necessarily even go, go to your

1013
01:06:22.949 --> 01:06:25.719
library. You can get it directly at the internet.

1014
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:29.699
So, Doctor Gallagher, thank you so much again for
