00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.990
Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the

2
00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:05.860
Center. I'm your host as always Ricardo Loops. And

3
00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:09.739
today I'm joined by doctors Darcia Narvaez and Gay

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.630
Bradshaw. Doctor Darcia Narvaez is a Professor of Psychology

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.000
Merit at the University of Notre Dame. And Doctor

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.680
G Bradshaw is a psychologist and Ecologist and director

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.610
of the Kulu Center for Nonviolence. And today we're

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.270
focusing on their book. They Evolved Nest Nature's Way

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.709
of raising Children and creating connected communities. So, welcome

10
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.400
to the show. It's a pleasure to have you

11
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:36.700
both

12
00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:39.110
on. Great to be here.

13
00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:43.889
So I would like to start by asking what

14
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.500
is exactly the premise of the book and what

15
00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:50.119
is an evolved next?

16
00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:54.409
Well, every animal has a nest for uh raising

17
00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:57.729
its young. It's a developmental system that has uh

18
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.650
been shaped through evolution to optimize normal development. And

19
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.589
so these are uh just part of our adaptation

20
00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:09.669
as animals

21
00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:16.440
a and are these uh species specific or are

22
00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:20.620
they or are there some commonalities across species?

23
00:01:21.339 --> 00:01:25.860
There are commonalities and differences too? So it's uh

24
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.839
that's what's fun about the book is that we

25
00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:32.110
note the similarities and then we point out, oh,

26
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.650
look at how they do it, that this animal

27
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.069
species does it this way and, and that kind

28
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.160
of thing. So, uh it's just a um a

29
00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:44.110
way of raising the young that is about nurturance

30
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.069
and meeting the needs of the young, the basic

31
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.150
needs without delay, without, you know, depending on the

32
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.400
species, what that means and to foster a sense

33
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.430
of connectedness of safety, of security and of uh

34
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.440
physiological, mental, psychological well being. Yeah, I think what

35
00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:05.440
the book does is really uh cements what has

36
00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:09.460
been known in uh Western science for hundreds of

37
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.830
years actually. But in particular, the last decades when

38
00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.179
neuroscience has come to the fore and that's that

39
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.050
all animals and now there's going to be including

40
00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:23.259
the data and theory and experimentation on plants, trees,

41
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.919
et cetera that we all share the same um

42
00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:31.145
capacities and structures of the brain or of the

43
00:02:31.154 --> 00:02:34.785
system that gives us the capacity to think, feel

44
00:02:34.794 --> 00:02:37.294
love and dream and all of those things. So

45
00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:40.044
that's really been known, but it's been quite tacit

46
00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:44.145
and this particular book and, and our collaboration really

47
00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:48.429
has shown that there's a uh that we're all

48
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.509
the same. It, it's rather than differences. The emphasis

49
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.160
is on diversity. So when you're saying, is there

50
00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.360
species specific? Yes, there is just like there are

51
00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.869
among human cultures. And I think that that's probably

52
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.149
the the the best way to uh uh readers

53
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.199
and listeners to approach. This is saying oh, you

54
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.649
know, we're all the same and yet we interact

55
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.889
and we express our interactions and experiences where we

56
00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.009
live in our, our history in different ways, just

57
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.160
as we look at different human cultures.

58
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.839
So there are very different aspects of child rearing

59
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.539
and our uh individuals from the same family or

60
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.589
community, establish relationships among themselves that you explore in

61
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.020
the book. We don't have time here, of course,

62
00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.255
to get into all of them. But let's get

63
00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:42.235
perhaps into a few examples. So could you tell

64
00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:47.645
us perhaps how mothers and all mothers uh the

65
00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:52.175
role they play basically in, for example, African elephant

66
00:03:52.184 --> 00:03:53.095
societies?

67
00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.679
Well, I'll start in Darsha, you can, you can

68
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.619
fill in with things. Um African elephants are a

69
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.679
prime example. They've been extremely well studied by science

70
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.869
and um a lot of people have a lot

71
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.830
of humans have a lot of affinity for them.

72
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.919
Um Just to clarify alo mother, uh mother usually

73
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:14.964
refers to the, the individual, what we would call

74
00:04:14.975 --> 00:04:19.945
the biological or the primary um caregiver that is

75
00:04:19.954 --> 00:04:22.545
female that would nurse, et cetera and give birth

76
00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:26.325
to an individual. Um Ala mothers are um other

77
00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:30.924
mothers and that is really the uh the norm

78
00:04:31.135 --> 00:04:36.244
among most human societies, traditionally, as well as uh

79
00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:40.519
animal um societies. So in the African elephants is

80
00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.609
that a baby is born from to a particular

81
00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:48.959
female elephant. And prior to the birth um that

82
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.359
mother and the baby who's in the mother is

83
00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:56.760
immersed in this constellation of aloe mothers, other mothers,

84
00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:01.029
there are siblings, there's, you know, teenagers, there's cousins

85
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.279
and babies and they're really this sort of organism

86
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.200
that moves around and, and uh is there to

87
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:11.880
support the mother prior to the birthing which takes

88
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.839
two years in, in African elephants at gestation. And,

89
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.890
and afterwards, so immediately when the baby is uh

90
00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:22.260
comes into the world from the mother's womb, uh

91
00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:28.450
he or she is literally surrounded by other elephants

92
00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:31.880
and family members and supporters. So you have seamless

93
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.200
connection um of being in this community. And, and

94
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.839
I think as we go on it really in

95
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.880
the sense of looking at the evolved nest and

96
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.720
child rearing and childbirthing, et cetera. The implicit, which

97
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.390
really should be made more explicit is the um

98
00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:51.630
the need and the role of a community. So

99
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.279
it's not just the mother, it's not just the

100
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.670
father, it's really a community effort of which the

101
00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:00.329
focal element of course, is the birthing, the birthing

102
00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.790
mother or birthing parent and, and the child.

103
00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:07.429
And of course, 00 yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

104
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.519
Yeah, it's interesting that our species uh we are

105
00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:17.260
apes. Uh We come from uh shared lineages with

106
00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:21.010
monkeys earlier and monkeys tend to share and have

107
00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:24.179
fowl mothering going on uh other nurturers and they

108
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.720
share their babies around, but all the other apes

109
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.359
except us uh keep uh it's just a mother

110
00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:35.269
that keeps her child because she doesn't trust the

111
00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:38.040
others. Uh And that they evolved then to just

112
00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:41.920
have mothers taking care of their young. But humans,

113
00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:46.570
we brought back the aloe mothering in it according

114
00:06:46.579 --> 00:06:51.200
to the evolutionary um ethology uh data. And that's

115
00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:53.880
really important for us because it actually shapes the

116
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.359
brain to be much more flexible in social relations.

117
00:06:57.369 --> 00:07:00.480
Because if you're only with one mother, at least

118
00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:03.299
for humans, you tend to be much more rigid

119
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:05.130
about how to get along with others because you

120
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.260
only have practice with one really, you know, in

121
00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:09.549
the first years. So you want to have a

122
00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:14.369
set of, of nurturers, people who are spons. Uh

123
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.929
It's good for the baby, but it's also good

124
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.730
for a mother because babies, the evolved nest is,

125
00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:22.579
you know, rather demanding for, in terms of baby

126
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:25.570
care. Uh We are like fetuses when we're born,

127
00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:27.809
fetuses of other animals for at least the 18

128
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.809
months, uh the 1st 18 months of uh of

129
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.130
age. And so babies need to feel like they're

130
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.709
still in the womb. Uh And that requires a

131
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.119
lot of holding and moms just can't do it

132
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.000
all. It's like what? So that's why our species

133
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.980
perhaps went back to this collective uh child raising.

134
00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:50.209
And uh the anthropologists tell us that it actually

135
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.529
shaped our big social brain to have cooperated child

136
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.320
raising so that we could have uh others providing

137
00:07:57.329 --> 00:07:59.890
the many calories we need to be to build

138
00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:00.600
a big brain.

139
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.579
So you mentioned holding the baby there, what is

140
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:11.260
the importance of physical contact for the baby? And

141
00:08:11.269 --> 00:08:13.850
also by the way for the mother or the

142
00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.820
other people who take care of

143
00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:20.250
it. Well, in uh the neuroscience is telling us

144
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:25.649
that the touch is central to helping establish uh

145
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.149
well functioning uh biological systems like the vagus nerve,

146
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.140
uh the 10th cranial nerve that innervates all the

147
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.808
major systems of the body. And it's being uh

148
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.729
it's also fostered by breastfeeding. Uh And um but

149
00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:43.359
touch is really important for that. And if you

150
00:08:43.369 --> 00:08:46.359
don't get the vagus nerve well established, you might

151
00:08:46.369 --> 00:08:49.210
have then health problems of various kinds later, you

152
00:08:49.219 --> 00:08:53.609
know, digestive issues, uh heart uh lung issues, brain

153
00:08:53.619 --> 00:08:55.780
seizures, that kind of thing. When the vagus nerve

154
00:08:55.789 --> 00:08:59.929
is malfunctioning, it's also the uh Oxytocin system. You

155
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.109
want the endocrine system systems to be established properly

156
00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:05.099
and touch really has a lot to do with

157
00:09:05.109 --> 00:09:08.130
that. You wanna have that cuddle hormone that carries

158
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:10.679
you forward. So you, you know, you actually like

159
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.460
to be with people and like to touch them

160
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:15.739
and feel comforted by that. So there's many different

161
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.200
neurobiological aspects that are are um affected by touch.

162
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:23.450
It's calming it. Uh OF course, is gonna have

163
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.690
epigenetic effects, turning genes on and off that are

164
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.789
gonna be oriented to good health and touch needs

165
00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:32.400
to be positive touch, not negative touch. We've got

166
00:09:32.409 --> 00:09:35.049
a lot of data now on how even spanking

167
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.059
uh a, a child is like uh physical abuse

168
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.549
or emotional abuse in its long term effects, making

169
00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:46.140
the individual more aggressive, less empathic and sensitive to

170
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.960
others. I think even at, at a deeper level,

171
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.289
when we look at um touch and we look

172
00:09:54.299 --> 00:09:57.580
at the aloe mothering or the alo parenting, um

173
00:09:57.619 --> 00:10:02.039
it really underscores that we're not these isolated units

174
00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:05.080
that essentially, yes, there is an individual that comes

175
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.450
into the world, but that's like a piece of

176
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.780
a bigger puzzle or a piece of the tapestry.

177
00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:13.179
And so what we see on the outside, you

178
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.549
know what Darsha was explaining and then looking from

179
00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:18.640
the neural sciences perspective, what's happening on the inside

180
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.989
from a science perspective is really a reflection of

181
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.750
the reality of oneness and connection, even if it

182
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.630
is in the case of the brown bear. That's

183
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.510
a chapter in our book. Um There isn't an

184
00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.640
Aloe family per se, it's a mother bear uh

185
00:10:33.659 --> 00:10:37.650
who births the babies. And uh it's the hibernation

186
00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:40.549
den, which is really the sort of the equivalent

187
00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:44.130
of the Aloe mothering elephants, et cetera. But it's

188
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.000
really the environment. And so in, in another way

189
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.929
too, it erases the difference between social and ecological,

190
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.130
those are just sort of different elements of the

191
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.929
same theme. So there is this uh continuity, there

192
00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.919
is this coherence and, and we see that as

193
00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:03.820
expressed in terms of what Darsh is describing as,

194
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.299
as touch and positive touch in that way. So,

195
00:11:08.309 --> 00:11:11.270
you know, it, it goes beyond the material. And

196
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.890
the neuroscience is, is just one way of sort

197
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.630
of keeping track of what those little pieces are

198
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.390
from the perspective of what science in our culture,

199
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.750
modern culture has relied on, which is dualism. But

200
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.409
really, we're looking at non dual consciousness, we're really

201
00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:29.619
looking at this um coherence of oneness.

202
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:36.929
So we've mentioned mothers and mothers here. What about

203
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.890
grandmothers and the other older people in the community?

204
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.549
What is basically the role played by elders in

205
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.969
human and nonhuman societies?

206
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.489
Well, they are part of the Aloe parents allo

207
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.210
mothers, other nurturers, right? And uh there is a

208
00:11:56.219 --> 00:12:01.169
grandmother hypothesis that the reason that women, human, human

209
00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:07.849
um women uh exist to live beyond menopause is

210
00:12:07.859 --> 00:12:09.630
so that they can take care of the young

211
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.770
because again, the young are young, need a lot

212
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.489
of calories. And, and there's data showing that when

213
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.650
you have the grandmother around the mother's mother, Children

214
00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:22.289
do better, they have uh more, you know, better

215
00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:25.979
health and so on. So that's uh kind of

216
00:12:25.989 --> 00:12:31.789
more of a anthropological view. The uh indigenous perspective

217
00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:33.929
of course, is that elders hold the wisdom of

218
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.140
the community and they uh they are repositories and

219
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.010
they have all the stories and experiences that help

220
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.650
the community uh survive and thrive wherever they are.

221
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.030
So it's very landscape specific. The language is from

222
00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:53.260
the landscape and uh they are essential for the

223
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.739
well being of the community and their care of

224
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.140
the very young Children is just ideal because they

225
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.570
both are sort of still in tune or attuned

226
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.880
to the UN manifest realm, the spiritual realm and,

227
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.989
and they're not so focused on, you know, working

228
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.570
and like, uh adults are so they really get

229
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.969
along well and, and the grandparents are much more

230
00:13:14.979 --> 00:13:17.010
forgiving and less rigid and so on with the

231
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.609
very young so that actually knits together the community.

232
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.229
And when the native Americans uh in Canada and

233
00:13:24.239 --> 00:13:29.510
the US uh were um considered savage and the

234
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.729
governments wanted to break down, make them, you know,

235
00:13:32.739 --> 00:13:36.099
kill the Indian and save the soul. They broke

236
00:13:36.109 --> 00:13:39.320
up those relationships, taking the Children away and it

237
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.450
really devastated the communities because the elders didn't have

238
00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.090
the young as an anchor for themselves and the

239
00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:49.830
young didn't have that community to foster their culture

240
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.599
and language and so on. So the intergenerational violence

241
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:59.130
uh continues uh from those horrible genocidal uh treatments.

242
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.619
Uh And of course, when we talk about child

243
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.669
rearing, we tend to focus a lot on the

244
00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:12.729
mother and sometimes also other females. But what about

245
00:14:12.739 --> 00:14:15.590
the father? Could you tell us perhaps about the

246
00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:20.549
example of Emperor Penguins and the role that fathers

247
00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:21.190
play there.

248
00:14:22.969 --> 00:14:28.809
We love Emperor Penguins. Of course, I'll start off.

249
00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:30.989
Um Yeah, I think a lot of people, they've

250
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.409
been popularized in movies I've heard and things like

251
00:14:33.419 --> 00:14:36.010
that. But the Emperor Penguins live in the Antarctic

252
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.669
and they're around 4 ft high. And just a

253
00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:42.210
kind of a cartoon sketch of, of the community

254
00:14:42.219 --> 00:14:44.229
is that the mother, the mother and the father

255
00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:48.510
meet and they form partnerships and make love. And

256
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.520
then the mother produces this amazing single egg and

257
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.919
it's very, very cold there. The conditions are very,

258
00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:59.900
very harsh. And so she eventually lays the egg

259
00:14:59.909 --> 00:15:02.599
and is essentially when she does that, it's almost

260
00:15:02.609 --> 00:15:07.739
immediately passed to the father who is um now

261
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.780
receives the egg and immediately puts it under his

262
00:15:10.789 --> 00:15:13.760
feathers in this pouch. And the purpose of that

263
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.719
is because the the extreme cold there, the wind

264
00:15:16.729 --> 00:15:20.549
chill factors makes it even greater and he takes

265
00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:22.830
care of the egg while the egg is becoming

266
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.140
a baby and the mothers um they live in

267
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.260
a colony, I mean, there's all these individual pairs

268
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.900
and different relationships but they are within a, a

269
00:15:31.909 --> 00:15:35.789
community. Uh It's a colony and the mothers essentially

270
00:15:35.799 --> 00:15:39.340
all leave at that time, they birth roughly probably

271
00:15:39.349 --> 00:15:41.849
at the same time and they go up to

272
00:15:41.859 --> 00:15:45.369
a couple kom a couple 100 kilometers away off

273
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.229
the ice and into the ocean. And that is

274
00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:51.320
to replenish because all of their energies has been

275
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.460
diverted and, and directed toward creating the egg and

276
00:15:56.469 --> 00:15:59.820
all the nutrients and psychological, emotional everything has. So

277
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:02.650
this is going off to replenish and they spend

278
00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:05.299
a couple of months there diving and looking for

279
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:08.619
fish and, and uh resting up and replenishing in

280
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.289
the meanwhile, the fathers are gathering, they each have

281
00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:14.940
an egg. Uh AND again, it's very protected and

282
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.619
they gather in what's called a huddle, which are

283
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.369
a group of, of uh fathers. And they do

284
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:26.169
that. Um YOU know, well, from a physical perspective

285
00:16:26.179 --> 00:16:28.770
is that because it retains warmth, it becomes this

286
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.909
kind of thermal unit by which the temperatures of

287
00:16:33.919 --> 00:16:37.299
the egg can be kept perfect, not too hot,

288
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.010
not too cold. And in order to do that,

289
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.219
they actually move, you know, in, in a very

290
00:16:43.229 --> 00:16:46.909
choreographed way to the interior of the huddle and

291
00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:49.780
then some go to the outside. So again, this

292
00:16:49.789 --> 00:16:53.070
is this co ordination. Again, this is a community

293
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.320
so that there's a baby, but it's a community

294
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.359
and then the baby is born and at that

295
00:16:58.369 --> 00:17:02.020
time, the mother returns and essentially, then the fathers

296
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.229
go off and they are also depleted. Um Some

297
00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:07.358
have lost half their weight, they go to the

298
00:17:07.368 --> 00:17:09.839
ocean and replete and then they come back and

299
00:17:09.848 --> 00:17:12.699
it's a very emotional and very intense time because

300
00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.618
typically the colonies are in the thousands and they

301
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.640
have to find their mother and their wife and

302
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:23.358
child. So, um doctor Andre who's in France is

303
00:17:23.368 --> 00:17:26.709
a researcher talks very beautifully about this that um

304
00:17:26.719 --> 00:17:28.810
they're very mindful. So again, we're talking about a

305
00:17:28.819 --> 00:17:31.630
community and this is an important point because they're

306
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.030
all coordinating together. There isn't this notion of competition

307
00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:37.689
there isn't this notion of me first or anything

308
00:17:37.699 --> 00:17:41.170
like that. Um They give particular calls, they each

309
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.400
have their own idiolect call. And if, if the

310
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.469
guy next to you is calling for his, they

311
00:17:46.479 --> 00:17:49.400
wait for, until that person can call and identify.

312
00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:53.349
So eventually they're all uh brought back together and

313
00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:55.920
they uh form a, a family and it's very

314
00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.319
much, um the term is co parenting. So, so

315
00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:02.819
there's a very much coordinate at many scales between

316
00:18:02.829 --> 00:18:06.109
the mother and the father, including the egg and

317
00:18:06.119 --> 00:18:08.810
then the mothers with the mothers and the fathers

318
00:18:08.819 --> 00:18:12.170
with the fathers. And then again, as the baby

319
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.530
matures, then there is a crash uh uh uh

320
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.699
uh you know, a kind of a coalescing of

321
00:18:18.709 --> 00:18:21.170
all the young chicks, um you know, kind of

322
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.630
like a kindergarten or whatever, but they're all together,

323
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.500
there really isn't any kind of separation. And the

324
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:31.069
other idea is that connection is with community nonparent

325
00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:34.599
and, and with each other in that way. So

326
00:18:34.609 --> 00:18:37.609
it, again, this is just an example and we

327
00:18:37.619 --> 00:18:40.930
have examples uh in the chapter on gray wolves,

328
00:18:40.989 --> 00:18:43.800
which is different, but it, there does show the

329
00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.400
participation of the, of the um of, of males

330
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:48.989
and same with the elephants. So I'll just put

331
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.479
that in real quick is um that uh the

332
00:18:52.489 --> 00:18:55.160
baby elephants in Africa, they grow up in that

333
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.640
Natal family we described and then when they're, you

334
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.760
know, 1112, 13, they are either pushed out or

335
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.959
they go out and they join, um, uh, older

336
00:19:04.969 --> 00:19:06.839
males, what they call an all bull group or

337
00:19:06.849 --> 00:19:09.880
area. And they spend at least 15 years, um,

338
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:14.099
in association with this bull society, male society. So

339
00:19:14.109 --> 00:19:16.520
there is not that kind of segregation that we

340
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.719
see. We see this very much cooper and I

341
00:19:19.729 --> 00:19:22.140
would say just not even a division. It's just

342
00:19:22.189 --> 00:19:25.199
everyone has the same goal and they work with

343
00:19:25.209 --> 00:19:26.949
each other to make it work in the best

344
00:19:26.959 --> 00:19:29.069
way possible for the babies and each other.

345
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.270
Mhm uh And so I guess that one very

346
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:39.449
important topic also to talk about here is attachment

347
00:19:39.459 --> 00:19:41.890
theory. I guess it is very important in the

348
00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.930
context of your book as was originally developed, I

349
00:19:45.939 --> 00:19:49.459
think by Doctor John Bulby and then over the

350
00:19:49.469 --> 00:19:54.994
decades further developed by other researchers and scholar. So

351
00:19:55.005 --> 00:19:57.194
what would you say are perhaps some of the

352
00:19:57.204 --> 00:20:01.015
main insights that we got from attachment theory when

353
00:20:01.025 --> 00:20:05.454
it comes to having a better understanding of perhaps

354
00:20:05.464 --> 00:20:10.694
the social needs that we and other species might

355
00:20:10.704 --> 00:20:15.244
have and how we establish social relationships with other

356
00:20:15.255 --> 00:20:15.824
people.

357
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:22.270
I'll start uh attachment has to do with relation,

358
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:27.530
relational belonging, essentially and connectedness and maintaining that um

359
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.910
those years when the brain is growing so quickly

360
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.790
that, you know, it's, it's setting up its worldview,

361
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.630
its sense of self, its sense of relationships. And

362
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.069
so uh the uh attachment promoting care which is

363
00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:45.010
evolve nest, then establish this this deep sense of

364
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:50.339
security and safety and relation and, and skilled, knowing

365
00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:53.640
how to, you know, stop and start relationships or

366
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:59.219
conversations and recognizing who's trustworthy and um just being

367
00:20:59.229 --> 00:21:02.650
able to maintain relationships across time, babies have to

368
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.300
learn a lot of non verbal skills before language

369
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.349
comes about around age two. And a lot of

370
00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:12.630
that is this relational kind of socio emotional intelligence.

371
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.910
So it has also to do with your own

372
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.219
uh understanding of your own emotions and conveying those

373
00:21:18.229 --> 00:21:21.510
in ways that are appropriate um with your uh

374
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.270
relational experience in the moment?

375
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.579
A and is it uh just about, or is

376
00:21:30.589 --> 00:21:35.060
it even primarily about the mother infant diet or

377
00:21:35.069 --> 00:21:37.969
does it go beyond that? Because I mean, at

378
00:21:37.979 --> 00:21:43.219
least when we commonly hear about attachment and attachment

379
00:21:43.229 --> 00:21:47.260
theory, it's it tends to be mostly focused on

380
00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.000
the mother, sometimes the other caregivers like the father,

381
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.739
for example, but people do not at least commonly

382
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.760
talk about other kinds of social relationships. But if

383
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.400
I understand it correctly, it goes beyond that.

384
00:22:02.699 --> 00:22:06.859
Right. Right. So in Western civilization, which has become

385
00:22:06.869 --> 00:22:12.089
patriarchal uh and emphasize the nuclear family, all you

386
00:22:12.099 --> 00:22:14.310
have is mom, dad and the Children, right, the

387
00:22:14.319 --> 00:22:17.420
emphasis of Western scholars has been to look at

388
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.680
the mother child diet because that's the framework, the

389
00:22:20.689 --> 00:22:23.729
assumption that that's normal, but that isn't normal for

390
00:22:23.739 --> 00:22:27.925
our species. Our species raised Children in multiple aged,

391
00:22:27.935 --> 00:22:31.084
multi gender groups. And so really the way I

392
00:22:31.094 --> 00:22:34.035
look at it is, mother provides the first attachment

393
00:22:34.045 --> 00:22:36.944
and then she's the bridge to the attachment to

394
00:22:36.954 --> 00:22:39.984
everyone else around. So that even in some uh

395
00:22:39.994 --> 00:22:44.810
societies, I think the booty, the the infant after

396
00:22:44.819 --> 00:22:47.819
a few days is passed around uh to the

397
00:22:47.829 --> 00:22:51.739
group, uh whatever size it is and the baby

398
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.489
starts to get a sense of different smells and

399
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.699
different uh patterns of movement and gets comfortable with

400
00:22:58.709 --> 00:23:01.040
all that and and builds a really a a

401
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:06.505
very a fabric supportive care around them. So they,

402
00:23:06.515 --> 00:23:08.944
and they become attached even more than just to

403
00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:11.665
people, to the natural world, around them, to the

404
00:23:11.675 --> 00:23:14.125
animals and plants that they live with and uh

405
00:23:14.135 --> 00:23:17.974
interact with. And so it's much broader, this attachment,

406
00:23:17.984 --> 00:23:22.564
this sense of being belonging and connected and relationally

407
00:23:22.584 --> 00:23:26.354
um kind of supported than what the Westerners uh

408
00:23:26.364 --> 00:23:28.324
are studying and talk about.

409
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.469
But what are essentially the factors that lead to

410
00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:39.729
the development of a secure attachment style and not

411
00:23:39.739 --> 00:23:43.310
uh let's say non secure attachment style that could

412
00:23:43.319 --> 00:23:48.290
be an anxious, violent or disorganized kind of attachment

413
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.709
style,

414
00:23:49.829 --> 00:23:51.989
but it has to do with the predictability of

415
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.449
the caregivers. So providing the evolved nest, so providing

416
00:23:56.459 --> 00:24:00.280
breastfeeding when the child signals they want uh touch.

417
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:05.310
When in our ancestral context, nomadic foraging communities, babies

418
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:08.550
aren't put down, they're carried everywhere because they know

419
00:24:08.949 --> 00:24:11.709
uh they had intuitions about how that baby is

420
00:24:11.719 --> 00:24:16.849
so vulnerable and required such uh intensive care of

421
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.689
uh to develop well. And so the baby is

422
00:24:20.699 --> 00:24:27.050
having um relationships that are um always responsive and

423
00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.709
nurturing in terms of touch and just listening and

424
00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:36.150
emotionally honest and delightful. And in those situations, the

425
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.000
baby learns that everything is, you know, you can

426
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.920
predict it and um I'm safe and these people

427
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.949
are trustworthy and all that insecure attachment comes from

428
00:24:44.959 --> 00:24:49.160
un inconsistent care. Uh We, and we uh see

429
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.260
that not in nomadic foraging communities unless there's been

430
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:56.020
some horrible accident or something. Uh But in modern

431
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.420
culture where babies are kind of, you know, more

432
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:04.520
like possessions than objects of control. And uh when

433
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.619
babies are left alone or left to cry, uh

434
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.500
and isolated physically, they're not gonna feel that sense

435
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.020
of belonging and safety and security. And so we

436
00:25:15.589 --> 00:25:18.989
unfortunately have cultural myths about how important it is

437
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.380
to make babies independent, you know, and oh, you're

438
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.079
gonna spoil the baby if you pick them up

439
00:25:23.089 --> 00:25:27.170
too much and all these crazy ideas uh that

440
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.530
actually undermine health for the long term. So when

441
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.300
you can, when you uh build an insecure attachment,

442
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.050
which could be anxious or avoiding depending on uh

443
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.900
exactly when and how you were treated when you're

444
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.729
insecure you, uh it means your neurobiology has been

445
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.369
shaped to be, you know, kind of disregulation and

446
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.750
you don't maybe know how to make friends and

447
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.729
you don't know how to maintain a friendship and

448
00:25:49.739 --> 00:25:52.890
you don't know how to recognize a trustworthy relationship.

449
00:25:53.239 --> 00:25:54.689
And so it gets you into all sorts of

450
00:25:54.699 --> 00:25:59.055
trouble. Uh PROF uh professors tend to have avoidant

451
00:25:59.064 --> 00:26:01.974
attachment, which is this detached way of looking at

452
00:26:01.984 --> 00:26:05.415
things not emotionally available because that's how, what they

453
00:26:05.425 --> 00:26:07.984
experienced as babies. And so it's very easy to

454
00:26:07.994 --> 00:26:09.935
go in the Ivory Tower and make up stuff,

455
00:26:09.944 --> 00:26:11.704
you know, and then apply your, you know, your

456
00:26:11.714 --> 00:26:14.505
little model to the world. Maybe it works, maybe

457
00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:16.925
it doesn't, but you get a publication and, you

458
00:26:16.935 --> 00:26:21.930
know, you're not committed and emotionally attuned. Um And

459
00:26:21.939 --> 00:26:24.250
so we've created a world where we reward that

460
00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.069
kind of um avoid an attachment uh with, you

461
00:26:28.079 --> 00:26:31.319
know, status and such and that's destructive to the

462
00:26:31.329 --> 00:26:35.050
planet. It's destructive to nature because we're not relationally

463
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.979
attuned with our emotions, with our commitment, with our

464
00:26:37.989 --> 00:26:42.280
moral commitment to the well being of everyone human

465
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:46.920
and nonhuman around us. And, and I would say

466
00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.380
that um John boldly really made quite a contribution

467
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:54.619
because he really made visible, the invisible, which was

468
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.359
this notion of the importance of relationship and the

469
00:26:57.369 --> 00:27:01.680
quality of relationship. But within that, again, this is

470
00:27:01.689 --> 00:27:04.319
not a criticism because that's a it's a step

471
00:27:04.329 --> 00:27:08.390
in the evolution of the western cultures way of

472
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.119
looking at things. You're still having one thing attaching

473
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:14.599
to another thing. And when you look through the

474
00:27:14.609 --> 00:27:19.359
lens of nonhuman nature, everyone's attached, there is no

475
00:27:19.369 --> 00:27:22.869
attachment, there are no strings, it's all one big

476
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.550
soup. So quote, unquote, attachment is just the way

477
00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.890
animals live. And so that the, the specificity of

478
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.650
it, for example, the, the importance of the mother

479
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.890
with the nursing, the way Darsha was discussing it

480
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.119
or the, the, the way that the, the passing

481
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.349
of the egg with the father, those are important

482
00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:47.819
elements, but it's all everyone's attached. It's the non

483
00:27:47.829 --> 00:27:50.859
attachment that um Darsha was talking about in the

484
00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:53.699
sense of some kind of perturbation, some kind of,

485
00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:57.869
you know, causing a gap or schism between you

486
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.260
and me. Um OR you know, the baby and

487
00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:06.030
the parent or whatever that is, that's the anomaly.

488
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.640
And, and essentially so, like I said, when we

489
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.819
look from through the baseline of nonhuman nature, there

490
00:28:11.829 --> 00:28:14.459
is no attachment. It's we, we are all attached

491
00:28:14.469 --> 00:28:18.339
and that's really what we're coming back into. And

492
00:28:18.349 --> 00:28:20.479
um and, and the work that we've done together

493
00:28:20.489 --> 00:28:23.430
is really trying to bridge that and, and move

494
00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:27.459
us into this paradigm of the baseline of we're

495
00:28:27.469 --> 00:28:30.479
all attached. We, we are, we just are in

496
00:28:30.489 --> 00:28:33.530
that way. So the evolved nest is about meeting

497
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.709
basic needs, everyone's basic needs. There's no argument about

498
00:28:36.719 --> 00:28:39.050
meeting the needs that you just provide and that

499
00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.729
and nature's gift economy is that way too. You

500
00:28:41.739 --> 00:28:44.589
take the fruit and then you, you, your waste

501
00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:48.790
becomes some other animals uh food. And uh it's

502
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.790
just this ongoing cycle of giving and taking and

503
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.555
giving without uh a sense of disconnection, right? You're

504
00:28:55.564 --> 00:28:57.444
just in it like uh gay said in a

505
00:28:57.454 --> 00:29:00.125
soup and what the Western world has done is

506
00:29:00.135 --> 00:29:04.275
just divided and disconnected all over the place, disconnected

507
00:29:04.285 --> 00:29:09.984
body from mind, uh spirit from uh humanity. Uh

508
00:29:09.994 --> 00:29:14.324
It's just a, a big mess of division that

509
00:29:14.435 --> 00:29:17.194
I, we hope our book will help people realize

510
00:29:17.204 --> 00:29:19.505
that that's not the way we evolved to be

511
00:29:19.515 --> 00:29:23.079
and that's not helpful for the planet. And then,

512
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.739
yeah, go ahead and just real quick. I think

513
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.420
what's a challenge? And we're hoping as Darsha said

514
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:33.589
that the book will help, you know, support people

515
00:29:33.599 --> 00:29:38.150
make that shift is essentially from one paradigm of

516
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.500
dualism. We can call it dualism pieces. You know,

517
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.969
all the pieces. You me, they, we all those

518
00:29:43.979 --> 00:29:48.599
things into oneness into non dualism. And it really

519
00:29:48.609 --> 00:29:52.420
takes um either an experience or a leap of

520
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.520
faith. But you, you, you at one point, you

521
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.180
have to kind of jump in, you have to

522
00:29:59.189 --> 00:30:01.500
jump in and say, do we see ourselves as

523
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.739
you and me and separate that we're putting together

524
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:08.449
an assemblage? Or are we just one of which

525
00:30:08.459 --> 00:30:11.479
I'm an expression? You're an expression of a part,

526
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.939
et cetera. And that's really what this is an

527
00:30:15.949 --> 00:30:21.150
example of, of, of um encouraging people to jump

528
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.290
into that new view because then the other pieces

529
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.410
like the elements of the evolved nest, they just

530
00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.660
kind of come out naturally. I mean, there may

531
00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.349
be some questions like, well, how do I do

532
00:30:30.359 --> 00:30:32.750
this? How do I transition, you know, I don't

533
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.349
have a grandparent or whatever, but then solutions start

534
00:30:36.359 --> 00:30:38.510
to come up. OK? We don't have grandparents, but

535
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.359
we have our neighbors. Let's start to talk with

536
00:30:41.369 --> 00:30:45.050
our neighbors and create this kind of um you

537
00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:49.890
know, mosaic um that, that, that moves into to

538
00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:54.530
oneness. So we're talking about in inter being, right?

539
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.560
We are all uh you are me, I am

540
00:30:57.569 --> 00:31:00.650
you, it's uh there's no real separation. We're just,

541
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.140
you know, little uh pieces of the whole, the

542
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:07.989
implicate order and our uh ability to de differentiate

543
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.270
ourselves to see how we're alike, to see how

544
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.280
we are connected. And all in this flowing dynamic

545
00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:19.170
universe is really our aim here and the animal

546
00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.189
uh images and how they, they know this, right?

547
00:31:22.199 --> 00:31:24.449
We have so much to learn from our animal

548
00:31:24.459 --> 00:31:27.130
kin. Uh And so we hope that's what the

549
00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.390
book will. Uh

550
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.560
But at a certain point there, you mentioned uh

551
00:31:32.569 --> 00:31:37.140
needs uh what are needs exactly or perhaps a

552
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.859
better question is where do they come from exactly

553
00:31:40.869 --> 00:31:45.619
what constitutes a child's in need? And I mean,

554
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.569
since uh of course, in the book, we explore

555
00:31:48.609 --> 00:31:53.219
other nonhuman species, uh does that mean that perhaps

556
00:31:53.229 --> 00:31:57.099
some of the of these needs are quote unquote,

557
00:31:57.109 --> 00:32:02.780
hard wired or uh are there are Children perhaps

558
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.560
at least to some extent responsive to the eco

559
00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:10.199
uh the ecology they develop in uh when it

560
00:32:10.209 --> 00:32:12.930
comes to developing their own specific

561
00:32:12.939 --> 00:32:16.089
needs? Well, the way I look at it and

562
00:32:16.099 --> 00:32:20.540
gay can uh add her perception. Uh THE way

563
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.819
I look at it is that we're animals. And

564
00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:26.630
so we all need some nourishment. We need shelter,

565
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.069
we need protection, we need warmth, uh or else

566
00:32:30.079 --> 00:32:35.040
we die, right? But, but we're also mammals, social

567
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.839
mammals and we need affection to grow. Well, we

568
00:32:37.849 --> 00:32:40.400
need the touch, right? We need play to grow

569
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:44.079
well, so basic needs to grow the optimal uh

570
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.239
kind of member of the species. That's what you

571
00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:50.160
want to meet. And that's we have to identify

572
00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:54.229
uh basic needs by what leads to optimality. And

573
00:32:54.359 --> 00:32:57.530
we also are humans, we need to have meaning

574
00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.030
uh and make meaning. And so the stories that

575
00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.959
our culture tells us, guides our behavior and guides

576
00:33:03.969 --> 00:33:08.459
our, our desires, our experiences build our desires, right?

577
00:33:08.469 --> 00:33:12.050
To be close and affectionate or distant and detached,

578
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.780
right? Depending on the kind of early experience you

579
00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:19.270
had. So basic needs really lead to optimization of

580
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.609
the individual and the community. Now, uh Maslow has

581
00:33:23.619 --> 00:33:27.689
had his hierarchy of needs. He learned he got

582
00:33:27.699 --> 00:33:31.770
inspired by the Blackfoot nation, the six AA. And

583
00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.400
unfortunately, he turned it upside down because for the

584
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:40.199
Blackfoot self actualization is fundamental in primary and that's

585
00:33:40.209 --> 00:33:42.680
what the evolved N does. For each individual. It

586
00:33:42.689 --> 00:33:46.170
fosters your uniqueness, you can unfold and blossom because

587
00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.979
all your needs are being mad and everybody loves

588
00:33:47.989 --> 00:33:50.250
you and you feel like you belong. But he

589
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.449
put that as the end point, the end point

590
00:33:52.459 --> 00:33:57.060
for the Blackfoot is cultural perpetuity community well being

591
00:33:57.069 --> 00:33:59.609
so that the culture will, and that means the

592
00:33:59.619 --> 00:34:03.410
bio community that in, in which you're entangled is

593
00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:07.089
going to live into the future seven generations, right?

594
00:34:07.469 --> 00:34:11.100
And we, you know, uh Maslow got very individualistic,

595
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.020
which is the western way instead of this communal

596
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.989
orientation that, that understands that we don't become our

597
00:34:17.998 --> 00:34:20.868
best selves unless we have those basic needs met

598
00:34:20.878 --> 00:34:22.599
all along the way throughout life.

599
00:34:23.978 --> 00:34:28.389
Mhm A and what I, in what ways can

600
00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:33.688
early life experiences have far reaching impacts?

601
00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:37.969
Well, that's what I write about uh quite a

602
00:34:37.978 --> 00:34:40.860
bit uh in terms of morality. Um BUT it's

603
00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:45.688
also social capacities. So uh as I mentioned earlier,

604
00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:48.938
within secure attachment, you're kind of uh hampered, you

605
00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:52.050
have a uh inability unless you heal it later

606
00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.800
with some interventions. Uh YOU get along that well

607
00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:59.120
with others. Now, my work looks at how our

608
00:34:59.129 --> 00:35:02.330
early experience, if you stress a baby so that

609
00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:06.360
they learn to be uh threat, reactive, stress, reactive

610
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.919
because they've been stressed so much that stress response

611
00:35:08.929 --> 00:35:12.399
is easily triggered, that's gonna shape how they act

612
00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:15.379
with others and their moral decisions. What's right? What's

613
00:35:15.389 --> 00:35:18.060
wrong? And in the moment, they'll be more likely

614
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.399
to feel afraid and brace against others, brace against

615
00:35:21.409 --> 00:35:24.879
life instead of being open hearted and flexible, you

616
00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:28.320
know, and attuned. So, uh that's gonna affect how

617
00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.439
they think about the world, they'll be more likely

618
00:35:30.449 --> 00:35:34.354
to have, uh, scripted, rigid ideas of black and

619
00:35:34.364 --> 00:35:38.354
white up and down, more oriented to dominance hierarchies.

620
00:35:38.364 --> 00:35:40.235
You know, either you're either up or you're down,

621
00:35:40.245 --> 00:35:42.425
you're either a winner or a loser, that kind

622
00:35:42.435 --> 00:35:45.165
of orientation. And each moment they can bring, uh,

623
00:35:45.175 --> 00:35:47.324
if they feel unsafe in the moment they're gonna

624
00:35:47.334 --> 00:35:50.375
go into that mode and their, their morality then

625
00:35:50.385 --> 00:35:55.209
is gonna affect everyone else. I mean, we're seeing

626
00:35:55.219 --> 00:35:59.810
far reaching, we're experiencing the far reaching effects of,

627
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.179
of early development. I mean, if you look at

628
00:36:04.169 --> 00:36:07.129
the history of, of humanity over the last, we'll

629
00:36:07.139 --> 00:36:10.489
just say 102 100 years, uh it has been

630
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.350
violent, it has been breaking down, it's been um

631
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:19.560
insecure attachment, generating writ large and none of that

632
00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.889
has been processed. So when you have someone who

633
00:36:21.899 --> 00:36:26.929
is severely traumatized um through genocide, through poverty, through

634
00:36:26.939 --> 00:36:31.699
the industrial technological development, which has gotten intensified. Um

635
00:36:31.709 --> 00:36:34.580
THE, the they're, they're thrust back into it and

636
00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.969
there really is an Ame or of there isn't

637
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:44.050
a um a healing, a receiving healing community. So

638
00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.989
even though a baby is brought up in a

639
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.379
certain that's obviously very critical. But the community, in

640
00:36:49.389 --> 00:36:53.879
other words, the culture has to be one that

641
00:36:54.149 --> 00:36:58.080
uh supports that individual. And if they're not, if

642
00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:01.110
they're the same thing in a sense, you just

643
00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.810
continue on this very, very destructive path, which is

644
00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.070
what we see right now. And unfortunately, in the

645
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.689
nonhuman world. That's why you're seeing PTSD complex ptsd

646
00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:15.209
just to use technical terms among African elephants never

647
00:37:15.219 --> 00:37:18.610
existed. Nothing like that. The orc is off Spain,

648
00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.120
nothing like that. And, and so, you know, we,

649
00:37:22.129 --> 00:37:24.239
we can just analyze it from a very narrow

650
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.840
view of neuropsychology. But essentially, you're seeing this profound

651
00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:33.939
ricocheting of, you know, one child experiencing insecure attachment

652
00:37:33.949 --> 00:37:37.610
and then it perpetuating, perpetuating, perpetuating without any kind

653
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.429
of balance in terms of healing that individual. And

654
00:37:41.439 --> 00:37:44.669
there are individual cultures, human cultures that have a

655
00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:47.919
very different way when an individual uh for whatever

656
00:37:47.929 --> 00:37:52.060
reason, um sort of steps out the bounds of

657
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.530
morality, what do they do? They do not expel

658
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:59.530
that individual, they gather around, they absorb, it's inclusive.

659
00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:02.280
And again, what Darsha was talking is about that

660
00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:07.820
inter being, it's our responsibility for that person, that

661
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:11.229
individual. And so that's, you know, these are elements

662
00:38:11.239 --> 00:38:14.179
of socialism, right? Where it has to do with

663
00:38:14.189 --> 00:38:17.219
the fact of that um your poverty or my

664
00:38:17.229 --> 00:38:20.469
poverty or their poverty or their problem, quote unquote

665
00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.540
is my problem. So it's a very different what

666
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.979
this is really saying is is that in order

667
00:38:25.989 --> 00:38:28.659
for us to uh heal, in order for us

668
00:38:28.669 --> 00:38:31.860
to bring cohesion and well being back on the

669
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.479
planet within our species and then the entire planet,

670
00:38:35.489 --> 00:38:39.500
which is made chaotic by our human behavior is

671
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:42.370
that we have to be inclusive. We don't shut

672
00:38:42.379 --> 00:38:45.010
them away in prisons, we don't stick people away

673
00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.679
and get rid of them, we bring them back

674
00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.340
and a number of the indigenous societies, that's how

675
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.860
they function. They, they, they sort of, you know,

676
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:57.209
absorb that individual. And again, that's another lesson of

677
00:38:57.219 --> 00:39:00.310
the evolved nest. It's not just a person with

678
00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.810
a mother or with a father, it's um, it's

679
00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:06.669
an organism. So, really, although we talk a lot

680
00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:09.020
about child raising and things like that, it really

681
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:15.459
comes down to, um, revitalizing those elements of the

682
00:39:15.469 --> 00:39:17.550
evolved nest which are in, I think chapter 10

683
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.679
or whatever, they're sort of listed. I mean, they're

684
00:39:19.689 --> 00:39:23.510
not, they're just kind of pointers to something which

685
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.780
is much of a, but that's really the focus

686
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.860
is that, that's how we can start on the

687
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.989
path, that's how we can break the cycle.

688
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.290
Mhm. Uh And do you think that perhaps some

689
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.739
of the issues that we are experiencing in industrialized

690
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.929
and post industrial societies nowadays have to do with

691
00:39:42.939 --> 00:39:47.449
some of these more individualistic values that we have

692
00:39:47.459 --> 00:39:51.530
where people are raised to think that perhaps they

693
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.989
shouldn't uh try to depend so much on others

694
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.959
and there's not so much the sense of community.

695
00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:02.370
Uh I mean, uh also because I guess that,

696
00:40:02.379 --> 00:40:06.429
uh uh looking at our own evolutionary history and,

697
00:40:06.439 --> 00:40:10.870
uh, and other species, we are very much dependent

698
00:40:10.879 --> 00:40:15.000
on others. And I mean, that idea that the,

699
00:40:15.205 --> 00:40:20.864
just an isolated individual, uh and, uh, and the,

700
00:40:20.875 --> 00:40:25.175
if it's not that then you're like spoiled or

701
00:40:25.185 --> 00:40:29.044
something like that and you are just completely over

702
00:40:29.054 --> 00:40:33.145
dependent on others. I mean, that's uh incorrect.

703
00:40:33.395 --> 00:40:36.564
That's it. It's particularly strong here, I think in

704
00:40:36.574 --> 00:40:40.745
the United States. Um, AND I think it's unfortunately

705
00:40:40.754 --> 00:40:45.330
spread but it, it's considered something negative or bad

706
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.399
to say I need, I need to something, you

707
00:40:50.409 --> 00:40:53.360
know, can you help me out? Um, THERE'S a

708
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:56.639
lot of shame associated with that and for the

709
00:40:56.649 --> 00:41:00.159
rejection. So you get this spiral. So, you know,

710
00:41:00.169 --> 00:41:03.219
to show kind of vulnerability is really considered to

711
00:41:03.229 --> 00:41:06.449
be something is used on as, as, as prey.

712
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.120
We have a predator, we've developed a predatorial culture.

713
00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:13.320
So when there's someone who is, who shows vulnerability,

714
00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:17.429
um they're rejected and they are uh preyed upon

715
00:41:17.439 --> 00:41:20.419
in, in that way. So again, the elements of

716
00:41:20.429 --> 00:41:23.520
the that are, you know, sort of itemized in

717
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:28.300
the evolved nest to highlight certain things really are

718
00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:33.010
um paths and principles which can really help our

719
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:36.989
culture. Um Our species return to, I would believe

720
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.229
it's, it's natural goodness where you want to call

721
00:41:40.239 --> 00:41:43.889
it in in that way. So I can add

722
00:41:43.899 --> 00:41:48.040
a little bit more um when we under care

723
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:51.239
for chil young Children. So don't provide the nest,

724
00:41:51.389 --> 00:41:55.050
we're undermining the development of the right hemisphere, the

725
00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:58.229
right hemisphere is scheduled to grow more rapidly. And

726
00:41:58.239 --> 00:42:01.659
it's the part of our brain that is oriented

727
00:42:01.669 --> 00:42:05.300
to dynamic relationships and living things and has a

728
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.949
sense of uh it's the seed of our self-regulation

729
00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:13.520
initially and empathy and higher consciousness. And when we

730
00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:17.000
under care for Children, that's uh you know, not

731
00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.280
developed so well. And then they have to rely

732
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.000
on the survival systems that are innate so that

733
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:27.330
dominance, uh submission and territoriality and rivalry things. Um

734
00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.860
PART of the reptilian brain, right? Um I mean,

735
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:34.600
it's insulting reptiles but um and then we send

736
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.639
them to school and train their left brain. Left

737
00:42:37.649 --> 00:42:40.300
brain is all in the ego consciousness. It thinks

738
00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.110
it knows everything, it doesn't know very much. It's

739
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.409
good at linear, you know, kind of analysis, but

740
00:42:46.419 --> 00:42:50.679
it can't deal with dynamism, it likes static objects,

741
00:42:50.689 --> 00:42:52.860
things it can measure, you know, and so the

742
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.580
western world has been taken over by the left

743
00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.935
hemisphere and this is Ian mcgilchrist Point and is

744
00:42:58.945 --> 00:43:02.165
running us, of course into the grave because we

745
00:43:02.175 --> 00:43:05.695
forgot how to develop, how to foster an integrated

746
00:43:05.705 --> 00:43:08.814
brain. Both halves are really important. But we have

747
00:43:08.824 --> 00:43:10.975
now put ourselves in the hands of this very

748
00:43:10.985 --> 00:43:16.155
detached robotic part of ourselves and guided by survival

749
00:43:16.165 --> 00:43:18.695
systems, you know. So predation is part of the

750
00:43:18.705 --> 00:43:24.280
left brain's orientation, manipulation of the world. Yeah. And

751
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.649
as, as Dar brought up the, the, the notion

752
00:43:26.659 --> 00:43:28.659
of the reptilian brain is kind of an artifact

753
00:43:28.669 --> 00:43:34.280
from science that reptiles, uh tortoises and alligators, rattlesnakes,

754
00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.199
they all have the same brain that we do

755
00:43:36.439 --> 00:43:39.229
and they all show uh the same what we

756
00:43:39.239 --> 00:43:41.780
would call prosocial behavior, they care for each other's

757
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:46.260
young. They are non a grass, um, they're very,

758
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:52.120
um, community oriented and, um, they don't strike in

759
00:43:52.129 --> 00:43:56.870
violence except, you know, when it's absolutely necessary. And

760
00:43:56.879 --> 00:43:59.010
so, you know, those are the kinds of myths

761
00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:02.610
which is also, have come along with, this is,

762
00:44:02.659 --> 00:44:07.570
um, uh, separating ourselves. Oh, we're not like them

763
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.449
now, whether that's another animal or whether it's another

764
00:44:10.459 --> 00:44:15.139
human and valor these aspects that, of the left

765
00:44:15.149 --> 00:44:17.590
brain in the, in the language of neuroscience that

766
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.320
Darsh has been talking about and that's very, very

767
00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:23.629
deep conditioning. So in the case of, you know,

768
00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:25.469
that this is this whole, you know, schooling the

769
00:44:25.479 --> 00:44:27.699
world, you know, even if you brought up, you

770
00:44:27.709 --> 00:44:30.520
know, um and, and I can have personal experience

771
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.860
growing if you grow up in an evolved nest

772
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:36.270
kind of situation, but you're shunted into this conveyor

773
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.280
belt of um you know, II I it's kind

774
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:44.090
of a sociopathy, you know, where you're basically punished

775
00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:48.219
in various ways and not just physical but socially,

776
00:44:48.229 --> 00:44:51.919
all those things you're conditioned into letting go of

777
00:44:51.929 --> 00:44:56.090
the right brain into uh into sort of squelching

778
00:44:56.429 --> 00:45:00.810
these wonderful and beautiful feelings inside that are natural,

779
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.760
which seed and nurture those uh um within those

780
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.330
that you, that you meet. So we're, we're put

781
00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.899
into this conveyor belt and then that becomes a

782
00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:14.949
matter of quote unquote survival. If you're not like

783
00:45:14.959 --> 00:45:18.939
this, then you don't belong and you're excluded. And

784
00:45:18.949 --> 00:45:21.899
unfortunately, it's evolved to such a system where it

785
00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:23.790
really comes down to, are you with us or

786
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.100
are you against us? We see that in political

787
00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.870
systems, we see that in social systems, et cetera.

788
00:45:29.449 --> 00:45:32.879
So it's really this move to um you know,

789
00:45:32.889 --> 00:45:38.439
taking back our wholeness, taking back ourselves. And in

790
00:45:38.449 --> 00:45:42.939
that, which is critical is understanding that nonhumans, that's

791
00:45:42.949 --> 00:45:45.159
why it works for billions of years. That's why

792
00:45:45.169 --> 00:45:48.399
nature has worked for billions of years. And so

793
00:45:48.409 --> 00:45:51.000
we can say, OK, I'm, I'm gonna side with

794
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:53.560
them. I'm gonna side with nature. I wanna be

795
00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:55.520
more like nature, I wanna be more like the

796
00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.979
penguins. I wanna be more like the wolves and

797
00:45:58.989 --> 00:46:02.439
by making that kind of solidarity, that kind of

798
00:46:02.449 --> 00:46:05.439
commitment saying those are my people, these are my

799
00:46:05.449 --> 00:46:10.919
kin then that in itself opens up an incredible

800
00:46:10.929 --> 00:46:15.780
amount of the life force that really is responsible

801
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:18.459
for creating this incredible planet that we live on.

802
00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:22.830
Mhm So I would like to ask you now,

803
00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:26.179
since in the book, you talk a lot about

804
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:31.610
what we can learn from traditional societies, indigenous societies,

805
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:37.860
for example, uh because in modern industrialized and post

806
00:46:37.889 --> 00:46:42.879
industrial societies, even with the issues that we have.

807
00:46:42.889 --> 00:46:46.590
Uh SOME of them we've talked here about today,

808
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:51.719
um we still have many positive things like for

809
00:46:51.729 --> 00:46:57.270
example, some very positive technological advancements that make our

810
00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.760
lives better and easier. So I would like to

811
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:04.879
ask you, how do you think we could perhaps

812
00:47:04.889 --> 00:47:10.610
strike a balance here between some of the positives

813
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:17.050
of those more traditional societies without perhaps having to

814
00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:21.520
ditch, uh, the other positive things that we have

815
00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:24.770
in our, uh, industrialized societies.

816
00:47:27.889 --> 00:47:31.800
Well, I think, um, it's a tough question actually,

817
00:47:32.219 --> 00:47:36.669
but there are traditional societies who weren't nomadic foragers

818
00:47:36.679 --> 00:47:40.760
who have lived with localization where they have their,

819
00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:43.169
you know, they raise their own food, they, they

820
00:47:43.179 --> 00:47:45.010
have their own energy. They have, they use the

821
00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.790
cycle of, of life on their farms, right? So

822
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.824
the waste from the animals or themselves goes into

823
00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:54.784
the garden and grows as the natural uh fertilizer.

824
00:47:54.935 --> 00:47:58.054
So they, they're not poisoning the the soil, they're

825
00:47:58.064 --> 00:48:02.054
not dishonoring uh this the earth and they have

826
00:48:02.064 --> 00:48:05.014
ways of being that are tuned in to the

827
00:48:05.024 --> 00:48:08.034
well being of that landscape right there. So I

828
00:48:08.044 --> 00:48:09.995
think we have to go back to these small

829
00:48:10.004 --> 00:48:14.020
kind of communities and then perhaps with the renewable

830
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:18.360
energies, we can still maintain zoom conversations, for example,

831
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:19.479
those are nice.

832
00:48:20.489 --> 00:48:23.080
Yeah, I would like to keep having

833
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:27.439
those. Yeah, but we don't need so much. I

834
00:48:27.449 --> 00:48:32.320
mean, there's so much wastefulness um in our because

835
00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.709
it makes money for people and it raises the

836
00:48:34.719 --> 00:48:38.699
G GDP, right? The more you waste. So we

837
00:48:38.709 --> 00:48:41.000
have to get back to understanding that we are

838
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:46.010
relational uh beings and every um plant animal river

839
00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.949
mountain is part of our kin and we need

840
00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:51.209
to be concerned about their well being and not

841
00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:55.080
be greedy for what we think we need. But

842
00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:57.110
you know, the early under care is gonna lead

843
00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.729
us to be more greedy and trying to make

844
00:48:59.739 --> 00:49:01.530
up for that hole we have in our heart

845
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:06.885
from disconnection from uh disrespected um early childhood. So

846
00:49:06.895 --> 00:49:09.245
we have to kind of work at multiple levels.

847
00:49:09.254 --> 00:49:11.794
Bring back the evolved n for the young re

848
00:49:11.804 --> 00:49:15.284
nest, the adults get them calmed down, get them

849
00:49:15.294 --> 00:49:18.794
more tuned in to the the cosmos, to their

850
00:49:18.804 --> 00:49:23.534
relational responsibilities, feel more at ease and at peace

851
00:49:23.544 --> 00:49:25.205
being a member of the earth community.

852
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:32.060
Uh And so perhaps just one last question and

853
00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:36.060
I have asked you about traditional society. So when

854
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.870
comparing ourselves to other animals and we've gone through

855
00:49:39.879 --> 00:49:43.790
several examples here today. Uh WHAT do you think

856
00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:48.909
we can learn from them that would be applicable

857
00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:51.429
to human societies?

858
00:49:52.729 --> 00:49:55.360
Well, I'll continue with what Darsha said. Um I

859
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:57.489
don't think we need any of the things that

860
00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:01.459
we call um human achievements. I mean, all of

861
00:50:01.469 --> 00:50:05.679
those things are prosthetics that are substitutes for what

862
00:50:05.689 --> 00:50:08.810
the evolved nest and the rest of nature lives

863
00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.439
by and provides. Um I mean, zoom. Zoom is

864
00:50:12.449 --> 00:50:14.310
wonderful because we get to meet you and each

865
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.989
other and, and things like that. But uh if

866
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.139
we were living together and whatever, we, we don't

867
00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.810
need that. I mean, I may not, I may

868
00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:24.629
have never met you. Um WHICH would be sad,

869
00:50:24.919 --> 00:50:28.189
but at the same time, how sad. I mean,

870
00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:30.659
in other words, they, what we, there's so much

871
00:50:30.669 --> 00:50:34.080
loss that is uh associated with the things that

872
00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:35.879
we think have gained us. I see these as

873
00:50:35.889 --> 00:50:39.159
this is their intermediate steps and that we need

874
00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:42.020
to give up those kinds of things. They, they

875
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:44.739
really, they keep us, I mean, right now, they

876
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:48.100
provide an incredible ability to kind of revitalize and

877
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:50.969
communicate and kind of get back to where we

878
00:50:50.979 --> 00:50:53.659
are. But none of the rest of the other

879
00:50:53.669 --> 00:50:58.060
species need what we say we need and they

880
00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:59.939
do very well and they're very happy. So all

881
00:50:59.949 --> 00:51:03.370
the things we cherish, like wellness and good relationships

882
00:51:03.379 --> 00:51:06.510
and security and peace. That's what the animal world

883
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:11.169
has without modern humans. And so if it really

884
00:51:11.179 --> 00:51:12.600
gets down to that, I think we just really

885
00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:14.810
need to sort of say, well, we don't really

886
00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:18.620
need all these things. These are just transitional objects

887
00:51:18.629 --> 00:51:21.209
that move us into what Darsha was talking about.

888
00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:26.520
Um AND life will be much better. So II,

889
00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:29.270
I think it's not just um I think, I

890
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.800
think we need to aspire to be who the

891
00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:34.100
animals are and who the trees and the plants

892
00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:40.620
are. And those with those with insecure attachment tend

893
00:51:40.629 --> 00:51:42.959
to be quite restless. They don't feel at ease

894
00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:46.540
and because of course, they didn't, they didn't get

895
00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:48.449
their needs met. And so they, they're anxious, you

896
00:51:48.459 --> 00:51:49.820
know, where am I gonna get them met? And

897
00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:52.389
so you try all these things, addictions and various

898
00:51:52.399 --> 00:51:56.229
things to try to calm down. Um, BUT if,

899
00:51:56.239 --> 00:51:59.280
if we provide the evolved nest or when we

900
00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:03.750
have nested lives, we have a fullness of now.

901
00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.929
We feel connected to everything now and we see

902
00:52:06.939 --> 00:52:09.090
all the dynamism and we can hardly, you know,

903
00:52:09.239 --> 00:52:13.149
look away from the beauty of, of life. Whereas

904
00:52:13.159 --> 00:52:15.489
when you have an under cared for, under nested

905
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.229
person, they're worried and they're, you're thinking about the

906
00:52:18.239 --> 00:52:19.969
past. Oh, I did all that wrong and they're

907
00:52:19.979 --> 00:52:21.570
depressed about that and then they're worried about the

908
00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.510
future and all and they're hardly in the present

909
00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.000
moment because they didn't get enough practice for it.

910
00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.800
They couldn't, I mean, it was too painful to

911
00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:30.919
be in the present moment. They had to dissociate

912
00:52:30.929 --> 00:52:33.030
when they were left alone to cry or left

913
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:36.550
alone, abandoned in some way. Uh So we have

914
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.070
to get back to the fullness of right hemisphere

915
00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:43.389
functioning, the full integrated brain where we feel uh

916
00:52:43.979 --> 00:52:46.840
this life is so beautiful and we are all

917
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.100
in it together and let's, you know, sing, let's

918
00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:52.600
dance, let's play together. That's what we aim for.

919
00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:57.060
That's, that's the flourishing human community that we um

920
00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:59.979
see as our promise, we can still return to

921
00:52:59.989 --> 00:53:03.600
that. Uh And so that's what we aim for.

922
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.389
And I think we see that um individually, I

923
00:53:07.419 --> 00:53:10.679
think everyone, why it feels so nice to be

924
00:53:10.689 --> 00:53:13.570
in nature. Hey, there, there are no TV. S

925
00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:18.340
there are no iphones. Um, JUST being in nature

926
00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:21.040
and then also just things like, um, I mean,

927
00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:23.080
not everyone but a lot of people have fun

928
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:27.889
having a picnic or have fun going camping. Well,

929
00:53:27.899 --> 00:53:31.580
that's because there's not all those things. Right. And,

930
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.600
and there is that so that those are sort

931
00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.969
of touch points and, and indicators that that's our

932
00:53:36.979 --> 00:53:40.719
natural, that's our natural path, that's our natural inclination

933
00:53:40.959 --> 00:53:44.429
to well being and peace. So we can all

934
00:53:44.439 --> 00:53:47.469
go find a sit spot near us where we

935
00:53:47.479 --> 00:53:50.889
can tune into nature and go there regularly and

936
00:53:50.899 --> 00:53:53.929
that'll open up our senses. We can all uh

937
00:53:53.939 --> 00:54:00.540
be um activists for our local rivers, creeks, forests,

938
00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.800
um trees, animals, native animals. Uh YOU know, it

939
00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:09.370
just get out there and be committed to the

940
00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:11.820
bio community that you're a member of.

941
00:54:13.729 --> 00:54:17.429
Great. So I think that's a great message to

942
00:54:17.439 --> 00:54:20.639
end the interview on. Uh THE book is again

943
00:54:20.649 --> 00:54:24.310
the Evolved Nest Nature's way of raising Children and

944
00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:28.409
creating connected communities. I'm leaving a link to it

945
00:54:28.419 --> 00:54:30.790
in the description box of this interview. Uh And

946
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:33.429
by the way, would you like to tell people

947
00:54:33.479 --> 00:54:36.709
apart from the book where they can find you

948
00:54:36.719 --> 00:54:38.709
and your work on the internet?

949
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:44.929
Uh The Evolve Nest Evolve nest.org. And we have

950
00:54:44.939 --> 00:54:48.409
a movie on this uh that's based in this

951
00:54:48.419 --> 00:54:51.879
book. It's uh eight minutes long there. And there's

952
00:54:51.889 --> 00:54:54.159
a couple other movies too that you can watch

953
00:54:54.169 --> 00:54:58.129
free. No, it's a nonprofit So there's different tools

954
00:54:58.139 --> 00:55:00.709
for re nesting. We have an evolved nest curriculum

955
00:55:00.719 --> 00:55:02.689
you can do on your own to learn about

956
00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:09.100
and then apply evolve nest principles and our um

957
00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:11.790
website where there's material as well as uh Kulas.

958
00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:18.639
It's www dot Kos K er Ul os.org and

959
00:55:18.649 --> 00:55:22.889
that's the Kula Center for Nonviolence. So theres information

960
00:55:22.899 --> 00:55:23.169
there.

961
00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.659
Great. So I'm adding that also to the description

962
00:55:27.669 --> 00:55:31.719
