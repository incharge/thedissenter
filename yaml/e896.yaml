  \ History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Leeds. He has held fellowships\
  \ from the British Academy and the Leverhulme Trust, and served as President of\
  \ the British Society for the History of Science (2014\u201216) and the International\
  \ Society for the History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology (2019\u2012\
  21). He writes and lectures frequently for general audiences, and has appeared on\
  \ BBC Radio 4\u2019s In Our Time and in the PBS/National Geographic television series\
  \ Genius with Stephen Hawking. In 2022 he was appointed to the Board of Trustees\
  \ of the Science Museum Group. He is the author of several books, including Disputed\
  \ Inheritance: The Battle over Mendel and the Future of Biology.\n\nIn this episode,\
  \ we focus on Disputed Inheritance. We start by talking about the work of Mendel,\
  \ how it relates to Darwin\u2019s, and also the work of Francis Galton on heredity.\
  \ We then talk about how people first took Mendel\u2019s work seriously, and the\
  \ work and debate between William Bateson and Walter Weldon. We also discuss the\
  \ aftermath of Weldon\u2019s death in 1906. We talk about a Weldonian course that\
  \ ran at the University of Leeds in 2013. Finally, we discuss whether Weldon\u2019\
  s approach to genetics connects in any way to the idea of the extended evolutionary\
  \ synthesis.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:28  The work of Mendel, and how\
