excerpt: Dr. Carol Ember is President of the Human Relations Area Files at Yale University
  and the editor of the journal Cross-Cultural Research. Most of her research career
  has been devoted to cross-cultural research on variation in marriage, family, kin
  groups, gender roles, predictors of war and other forms of violence, but for the
  last eight years she has been working on cultural adaptations to natural hazards
  and other resource stressors. She is interested in research that integrates the
  fields of anthropology as well as anthropology with other disciplines. She is the
  first author (with Melvin Ember) of Cultural Anthropology, now in its 15th edition
  and Anthropology (with Melvin Ember and Peter N. Peregrine), now in its 15th edition.

  \ topics in cultural anthropology. We start by talking about tight and loose cultures,\
  \ and the ecological factors behind them, including natural hazards. We talk about\
  \ altered states of consciousness, and male initiation ceremonies. We discuss how\
  \ human sexuality varies cross-culturally, and the bases of gender differences and\
  \ sexual division of labor. Finally, we talk about comparative cultural databases,\
  \ the challenges of using them, and the example of studying children\u2019s play\
  \ and work.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:59  Tight and loose cultures  \n\
