  \ of Developmental Psychology at the University of Groningen, Netherlands. He is\
  \ renowned for his work on developmental psychology and the application of dynamical\
  \ systems theory in social science. He is the author of A Dynamic Systems Model\
  \ of Cognitive and Language Growth, Dynamic Systems of Development: Change between\
  \ Complexity and Chaos, and, together with Naomi de Ruiter, Toward a Process Approach\
  \ in Psychology: Stepping into Heraclitus' River.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about\
  \ a dynamical systems theory approach to developmental psychology. We discuss what\
  \ is the evidence for psychology being a dynamic system. We talk about levels of\
  \ analysis, causality in psychology, and stages of development and critical periods.\
  \ We discuss a process ontology, and how it differs from a substance ontology. We\
  \ talk about 4E cognition. Finally, we discuss language development, and challenging\
  \ Chomskyan views of it; and theory-of-mind development, and the idea of innateness.\n\
