shownotes: "Dr. Colin DeYoung is Associate Professor of Psychology at the University\
  \ of Minnesota. In his research in personality psychology, he has examined the theoretical\
  \ structure of personality and the biological basis of personality.\n\nThis is our\
  \ second talk. You can watch the first one, on the Big Five personality traits,\
  \ here: https://youtu.be/hVh22rn5doQ\n\nIn this episode, we talk about personality\
  \ and psychopathology. We start by discussing issues with how psychopathology is\
  \ defined in psychiatry. We discuss whether statistical deviance should be enough\
  \ to classify something as psychopathology, and the relationship between brain disease\
  \ and psychopathology. We talk about the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology,\
  \ and approaching psychopathologies as dimensions. We discuss how we can distinguish\
  \ traits from symptoms, and the risk of iatrogenic effects due to misdiagnosis.\
  \ We discuss how each of the Big Five personality traits can contribute to psychopathology,\
  \ and the relationship between cognitive ability and psychopathology. We talk about\
  \ the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, Cybernetic Theory, and\
  \ personality traits. Finally, we discuss the current state of the neuroscience\
  \ of personality.\n\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00 Intro  \n00:49  Issues with how psychopathology\
