  \ and Computational Neuroscience at the University of Sussex, where he is also Director\
  \ of the Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science. He is also Co-Director of the\

  \nIn this episode, we focus on Being You. We start by discussing what consciousness\
  \ is, and how to study it scientifically. We talk about what consciousness is good\
  \ for. We address the recent \u201Ccontroversy\u201D surrounding Integrated Information\
  \ Theory of Consciousness, and discuss how science is done. We talk about the idea\
  \ of the brain as a prediction machine, how perception works, and how objective\
  \ reality relates to perception. We discuss the notion of \u201Cself\u201D. Finally,\
  \ we talk about what we know about non-human animal consciousness, and whether machines\
  \ can become conscious.\n\nTime Links:  \n00:00  Intro  \n00:40  What consciousness\
